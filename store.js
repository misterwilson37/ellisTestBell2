// ============================================================
// Tentacalendar — store.js  (2.0 / OCTODO LINE)
// Version 1.4.2
//
// Every Firebase call: auth, workspace bootstrap, subscriptions, CRUD.
// Nothing here touches the DOM. Schema per HANDOFF-2.0.md §3.
//
// 1.4.0 — FOLLOW-UPS WAIT FOR THE DAY YOU ACTUALLY FINISH. An "after end"
//          outrider becomes an UNDATED task (afterProjectId/afterProjectWd)
//          in Waiting on…, and setStageDone dates it from the finish — the
//          🎆 tick, or the last tick when there is no 🎆. Un-finishing sends
//          back only the ones still on the date we gave them. repegFollowUps
//          converts 1.1.0's already-dated ones. Every outrider task also
//          carries `fromStage` (for Duplicate) and every project-born task
//          `fromProjectId` (for listing under the project). Katie, items 4/10.
// 1.3.0 — SOFT DELETE (§0k.3). A project's ✕ now sets deletedAt/deletedBy
//          instead of destroying the document. It leaves the timeline, the
//          agenda and the project pane; its sessions and ticked stages stay
//          reachable THROUGH it, so the Time Report and whereis still total
//          honestly and nobody's work or credit dies to somebody else's bad
//          afternoon. ⚠️ NOT a revert of 0.28.0: orphaning the ledger and
//          destroying it are both wrong. subscribeProjects now calls back
//          with (living, all) — take `living` unless you ARE the ledger.
//          restoreProject undoes it; deleteProject still exists as the rare
//          permanent path and is gated on canSetUp().
// 1.2.0 — syncOutriders NOW STAMPS MISSING SIDS BEFORE IT SPLITS, and
//          without this the whole of 1.1.0 was a no-op on Katie's board.
//          import-transform.js rebuilds stages from an explicit field list
//          that omits `sid`, so every imported stage had none, and 1.1.0
//          skipped sid-less stages by design — skipping all 17 imported
//          projects, i.e. exactly the data §0h exists to migrate. Jake
//          caught it in the dry run. Stamping is additive, is confirmed
//          before any task is spawned, and repairs live projects that a fix
//          to the importer could never reach.
// 1.1.0 — see CHANGELOG.md.
//
// 1.0.0, 0.29.1, 0.28.0 — see CHANGELOG.md.
//
// ⚠️ Full version history is in CHANGELOG.md. Keep this header SHORT —
//    it grew to hundreds of lines, which is how the banner and the
//    constant below drifted apart four times. The constant sits on the
//    next line on purpose: you cannot edit one without seeing the other.
//    Verify with `node version-check.mjs` before handing anything over.

// THE MERGE SET (item 5)
//
// ⚠️ THE RULE IS JAKE'S AND IT IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE. The first design
// said shared tiers merge into your HOME board only, so visiting somebody
// meant seeing strictly their world. He corrected it, and the correction is
// better:
//
//   "If I'm sharing with a colleague and [I'm] in her house, then I won't
//    see that tier — I'm in her house, after all — but I don't want OUR
//    shared tier to disappear just because I'm in her house."
//
// So: A SHARED TIER FOLLOWS YOU INTO A HOUSE WHERE SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THERE
// ALSO HOLDS A KEY TO IT. In Katie's house, Family merges (she is in it) and
// the school tier you share with a colleague does not (she is not). In your
// own house everything you hold merges, including things nobody else on your
// board can see — which is why "my own house" is a separate arm of the test
// rather than a special case of it.
//
// Every input to this is readable: you may list the members of any workspace
// you are a member of (rules: `match /members/{email} { allow read: if
// canRead(wsId) }`), and both workspaces qualify — the shared one and the one
// you are looking at. Nothing here needs a rules change.

// on 2026-07-29 — a task typed into a shared tier landed on the author's own
// personal board, addTask resolved, the UI drew the task, the author saw it
// forever, and the person it was meant for never could. Nothing anywhere
// reported a problem, because writing to your own board is always permitted.
//
// A routing rule that cannot determine the destination must REFUSE. An error
// the person can see is strictly better than a document in the wrong
// collection: the first costs a retry, the second is invisible and permanent.
//
// ⚠️ THE FALLBACK WAS IN **TWO** PLACES, NOT ONE. The handoff named wsOfTier.
// `wsOf` had the identical `|| ws()` and it is the more dangerous of the two,
// because restoreDoc (D116's undo) routes through it and uses setDoc — which
// CREATES. Undo a delete on a shared tier after a reload, when the map is
// cold, and the task was silently re-created on your own board while looking
// correct on your screen and staying gone on theirs. That is TIER-10's
// failure exactly, and TIER-10 is one of the two tests flagged "can lose
// data". Both are closed by refusing.
//
// The old comment justified the fallback as covering "a brand-new document,
// or one created in this same tick". That case is now covered properly: every
// creator below stamps the map with the id it just minted, before returning.
// A guess was standing in for a stamp.

//
// Everything Jake described is that model pointed in one of two directions:
//   · An ADULT holds their own deed and invites others in.  (Katie, colleagues)
//   · A DEPENDENT lives in a house an adult holds the deed to. (Nico, students)
// There is no third mechanism and no special child code path — a dependent
// workspace is an ordinary workspace whose resident is not its owner.
//
// IMPORTANT, and it is a property rather than a feature: a shared board is
// ONE SET OF DOCUMENTS, not a copy. Two people watching the same workspace
// are watching the same documents, so a completion lands on both screens
// within a second and there is nothing to reconcile, ever.

// ============================================================
// SHARE A TIER / TAKE IT BACK  (E6, E8, item 5)
//
// E6: "a shared tier is a small shared workspace." There is no per-tier
// permission anywhere and there must not be — E1 makes isolation a property
// of the PATH, and a tier that stayed on your board while somebody else read
// it would be a field-level boundary wearing a path-level app's clothes.
//
// So sharing MOVES the tier and everything pointing at it into a workspace
// of its own, and both people hold keys to that workspace. Unsharing moves
// it back. One mechanism, two directions, same as houses and keys.
//
// ⚠️ THREE PROPERTIES THIS DEPENDS ON. Change any of them and re-read this.
//
//   1. DOCUMENT IDS ARE PRESERVED. Not cosmetic: parentTaskId chains,
//      projectId references and the sessions ledger all point BY ID, and the
//      merged view keys by id too. A move that reassigned ids would sever
//      every follow-up chain in the tier and silently orphan its time.
//      setDoc-at-a-known-id is already proven here — it is what restoreDoc
//      has done since D116.
//
//   2. COPY, VERIFY, THEN DELETE. Never the other order. A failure part-way
//      leaves DUPLICATES, which are recoverable and — because the merged
//      view keys by id — not even visible. A delete-first failure leaves a
//      HOLE, which is not recoverable and is exactly what Principle 3 says
//      must never happen.
//
//   3. UNSHARE IS ALSO THE REPAIR TOOL. If a share dies half-way, the
//      originals are still on your board and a half-populated shared
//      workspace exists; unshareTier brings back whatever made it across and
//      removes the workspace. That is the whole reason it ships in the same
//      increment rather than "later".
//
// eventsCache is NOT moved: it is a cache the hourly poll rebuilds from the
// tier's own gcalCalendarId, so the entries are deleted from the source and
// regenerate on the other side within the hour. Moving a cache is how a
// cache becomes a second source of truth.

 * ledger and destroying the ledger are both wrong, and neither is the other's
 * fix.** Soft delete is the third answer: the ledger keeps its parent, and
 * the parent keeps out of the way.
 *

 * ⚠️ 1.1.0 — OUTRIDER STAGES BECOME TASKS. THIS WRITES TO LIVE DATA.
 *
 * Katie's rule (handoff §0h): a project's pipeline is what happens DURING the
 * project; anything anchored outside the window is a task and always was. So
 * a −14d engagement letter leaves the pipeline and becomes a dated task that
 * can be rescheduled, escalated and finished on its own terms — the same
 * thing the hurrah's +N `spawnDays` already does at the far end.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE SAFETY PROPERTY: BUILD → VERIFY → STRIP, exactly
 * as moveTier does. A half-migrated project — stages gone, tasks absent — is
 * UNRECOVERABLE BY HAND, because the computed dates lived on the stages and
 * go with them. Never strip on an unverified write. Never strip early to save
 * a round trip.
 *
 * ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION, not by bookkeeping. Each spawned task takes
 * the DETERMINISTIC id `out_<projectId>_<sid>`, so running this twice cannot
 * mint a duplicate — the second run finds the task already there and adopts
 * it. That is why it is safe to call on every project load, on every date
 * edit, and from a migration sweep over the whole board, without a
 * `spawnedTaskId` guard to keep in sync. (The hurrah needs such a guard
 * because its task is minted with an auto id at tick time; this one does not,
 * and copying that pattern here would add a second authority answering the
 * same question — see the tierSkinOf note in §0r.)
 *
 * ⚠️ A TICKED OUTRIDER BECOMES A COMPLETED TASK, CARRYING ITS ORIGINAL
 * `completedAt` AND `completedBy` VERBATIM. Jake, 2026-08-01: *"the
 * reflection is important, and I don't want to lose any data."* Re-stamping
 * with the migration date would credit the wrong person on the wrong day —
 * the same failure `stampNewStages` exists to avoid (D59). An existing task
 * is NEVER overwritten: if someone has since rescheduled or completed it,
 * their version is the true one and this adopts it untouched.
 *
 * @param allowedDays  the OWNING TIER's working days. store.js cannot resolve
 *                     a tier's fields (`_where.tiers` maps id → board and
 *                     nothing more), so the caller passes them, exactly as it
 *                     does for every other queue computation.
 * @returns {spawned, adopted, stripped, skipped} — counts, for the caller to

/**
 * Replace a project's entire stage array (rename/reorder/add/remove, D42).
 *
 * ⚠️ 0.26.0 — THE EDITOR OWNS SHAPE. THE SERVER OWNS COMPLETION.
 *
 * This used to write the caller's array verbatim, and on a shared project
 * that destroyed the other person's work. The stage editor builds each row
 * from a snapshot taken when the MODAL OPENED, so every tick your colleague
 * made while you had it open was written back as un-ticked. Reordering three
 * stages silently un-finished two of theirs. Observed live on 2026-07-30
 * between two accounts: both sides read 4/8 and the four were DIFFERENT.
 *
 * The split is unambiguous because the editor has no completion control on
 * it — `.st-name`, `.st-dir`, `.st-anchor`, `.st-off`, `.st-hurrah` and
 * nothing else. It therefore never has a legitimate opinion about
 * completedAt/completedBy, and any it carries is stale by construction.
 *
 * So: re-read at write time, and for every incoming stage whose `sid` still
 * exists on the server, take completion from the SERVER copy. A stage the
 * server does not have is genuinely new (or is being restored by undo after
 * a delete), and there the caller's value is the only one there is.
 *
 * This is deliberately last-write-wins for shape and never-lose for
 * completion. Two people reordering at once still means one ordering wins —
 * that is a preference, and Jake has parked it. Neither of them loses a tick.
 */
/**
 * The merge rule, as a pure function — no Firestore, no auth, no clock.
 *
 * Split out from setProjectStages ON PURPOSE. This is the most consequential
 * logic added in 0.26.0 (it decides whether somebody's finished work
 * survives) and it was, for about an hour, the least testable: three awaits
 * deep inside a network call. `node stage-merge.test.mjs` exercises THIS
 * function against the real source. A rule nobody can test is a rule nobody
 * can trust, which is the same lesson `version-check.mjs` taught on the same
 * day, one floor down.
 *
 * `incoming` is what the editor wants the pipeline to LOOK like.
 * `live` is what the server currently says is DONE.
 * Server wins on completion for any stage it still has; caller wins for a
 * stage the server does not have (genuinely new, or restored by undo after
 * a delete — in both cases the caller holds the only copy).
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT EXPORTED (1.0.0), AND THE TEST STILL READS IT. stage-merge.test.mjs
 * lifts this function out of the source TEXT by a brace-matching scan and
 * strips `export` on the way, so testability never depended on the keyword.
 * Do not add it back "so the test can see it" — the test could always see it.
