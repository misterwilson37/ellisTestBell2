// Tentacalendar — queue.js
// Version 1.4.0
//
// Pure scheduling logic: priority, pipelines, week and clock geometry,
// holidays. Has never known Firestore exists — that is why it is testable.
//
// RECENT:
// 1.4.0 — WAITING ON… IS FOR LIVE PROJECTS (Katie). A follow-up waiting on a
//          project that hasn't started yet is left off (it's on the card);
//          a finished project's DATED follow-up shows, `upcoming`, until due.
// 1.3.0 — parseTypedDate: every date field can be TYPED (Katie, on Android,
//          whose picker cannot be). 10/15 · Oct 15 · fri · +2w · 1015 …
//          typed-date.test.mjs.
// 1.2.0 — FOLLOW-UPS WAIT FOR THE REAL FINISH. waitsForFinish,
//          projectFinishedAt, afterFinishDue, allowedDaysBetween,
//          outriderStageFromTask, repegPlan: pure answers for store.js's
//          "after end" outriders, which now sit in Waiting until the project
//          is finished and then date from THAT day, not the planned end.
//          Also: addAllowedDays steps CALENDAR days (was 24h — double-counted
//          the Sunday the clocks go back, on 7-day tiers).
// 1.1.1 — ⚠️ WAITING ON… NO LONGER FILLS UP EVERY WEEKEND. 0.21.0 checked
//          "is this tier off today?" BEFORE "is this task due today?", so on
//          a Saturday every dated task of every Mon–Fri tier went to Waiting,
//          due dates weeks away included. Katie: "'Waiting on' tasks seem to
//          only appear on weekends." Only a task dated TO the off day goes
//          there now — the one case 0.21.0 was written for. waiting.test.mjs.
// 1.1.0 — OUTRIDERS. `isOutrider` / `splitOutriders`: a stage whose computed
//          date falls outside [startDate, endDate] is not a pipeline step,
//          it is a task. Pure predicate only — store.syncOutriders does the
//          writing. projectPipelineWindow now collapses toward the project's
//          own dates, which is the intended consequence and not a regression.
//          ⚠️ An UNDATED stage is never an outrider, nor is any stage of a
//          timeless project: null means "not on the calendar", not "outside".
// 0.21.0 — A DATED TASK NO LONGER VANISHES ON ITS TIER'S OFF DAY. D61's
//          `continue` dropped it from active AND waiting AND everything —
//          a Work task dated to a Saturday existed in Firestore and appeared
//          on no screen, silently returning Monday as overdue. D61's intent
//          (Work must not nag on a Saturday) is kept; it now goes to WAITING
//          carrying `offDay: true` so the UI can say why. "Don't nag" and
//          "cannot be reached" are different things.
// 1.0.0, 0.20.0 — see CHANGELOG.md.
//
// ⚠️ Full version history is in CHANGELOG.md. Keep this header SHORT —
//    it grew to hundreds of lines, which is how the banner and the
//    constant below drifted apart four times. The constant sits on the
//    next line on purpose: you cannot edit one without seeing the other.
//    Verify with `node version-check.mjs` before handing anything over.
