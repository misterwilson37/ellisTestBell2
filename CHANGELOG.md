# Ellis Web Bell — Changelog

Release history for the main app (src/js / index.html; script.js before 6.0.0). Sibling surfaces (clock.html, old.html, dashboard-config.html, service-worker.js) carry their own version notes in their file headers.

## V6.4.0 — Usage dashboard (presence): design Layer 1 ships
(First built piece of DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md; additive schema per its I0.)

- **NEW `src/js/28-presence.js`**: self-starting heartbeat. Writes
  `artifacts/{appId}/public/data/presence/{uid}` — lastSeen, appVersion,
  schedule label + ids, displayName — when the visible schedule changes
  or every 5 min while the tab is visible (~12 writes/hr/user; hidden
  tabs pause, with a catch-up write on return). Failures log and never
  disturb the app. Departure = staleness; no goodbye write.
- **NEW `src/js/29-admin-dashboard.js`** + "Who's Online" in the Admin
  Zone: live table (name · running · version · last seen · active dot),
  summary counts (active now / seen today / total ever). Listener is
  lazy — attached on modal open, detached on close.
- The dashboard modal is the FIRST new modal authored on the 6.2.0
  data-modal chrome (jsdom-verified it assembles correctly).
- **firestore.rules**: additive presence block — write own doc only,
  read admins-only (reuses the isAdmin helper). MUST be published to the
  console for 6.4.0 to function; safe for live 5.79.x clients (no old
  code touches the path).
- **service-worker.js -> 1.11.0** (caches both modules).
- Census truth-in-advertising: only 6.4.0+ clients report. The school
  repo (5.79.x) reports nothing until the 6.x batch ships there —
  ideally before the first day of school, so day one = full census.
- clock.html presence (TVs/grids; it does authenticate) deliberately
  deferred — see the design doc's open questions.

## V6.3.0 — Schoolification pass: one-file branding
(Additive; zero visible change for Ellis — jsdom-verified no-op.)

- **NEW `/school-config.js`** (plain script, firebase-config.js pattern):
  appName, welcomeHeading, defaultSoundLabel, themeColor. Every value
  optional with Ellis defaults; heavily commented, including everything
  that deliberately STAYS manual (manifest.json is static JSON; replace
  ellisBell.mp3 but keep the filename — it's in the SW precache and saved
  preferences).
- **NEW `src/js/27-school-branding.js`** applies it at startup: tab
  title + banner (APP_VERSION appended, so the three-places version
  convention still greps the static HTML), welcome heading, theme
  preview, meta theme-color, all 8 default-sound dropdown labels, and
  exports APP_NAME (now used by desktop notifications). Text/attribute
  writes only — same safety pattern as 26.
- index.html: three branding targets got ids; loads school-config.js
  before the app module.
- **service-worker.js -> 1.10.0**: caches both new files.
- **old.html -> 1.7.1**: comment at PROJECT_ID pointing other schools at
  firebase-config.js's projectId (the page itself stays SDK-free REST).
- SETUP.md Step 8 rewritten around the one file.
- Verification: jsdom harness ran school-config.js + the branding module
  against index.html — title/h1/welcome/preview/meta + 8 labels all
  byte-equal to the static HTML with stock config. tailwind.css still
  byte-identical to 6.1.0.

## V6.2.0 — Stage 6b: template-generated modal chrome
(Structural, zero visual/behavioral change — proven, see below.)

- **index.html shrinks by ~7.2KB of repeated class strings.** The 45 modal
  backdrop wrappers, 42 standard white panels, and 66 standard buttons
  (40 gray cancel / 19 blue primary / 7 red danger) now carry data
  attributes (`data-modal`, `data-modal-panel`, `data-btn`) instead of
  repeated literal Tailwind chrome.
- **NEW `src/js/26-modal-chrome.js`** expands those attributes at startup —
  CLASS ADDITION ONLY (no elements created/moved/removed, so every
  getElementById reference and listener stays valid). Variants:
  `data-modal-align="start"`, `data-modal-z="<literal z class>"` or
  `"none"`. All deviations (three p-6 panels, buttons with text-sm /
  disabled: / hidden / w-full extras) were deliberately left bespoke.
- **Restyling all modals is now a one-place edit** (schoolification hook).
- **service-worker.js -> 1.9.0**: 26-modal-chrome.js added to CORE_ASSETS;
  cache bump busts 6.1.0 caches.
- **Verification**: transform done by `build/transform-modals.mjs` (kept
  for archaeology) with assertions — inline scripts byte-identical, id
  inventory identical, exact expected counts. tailwind.css rebuild came
  out BYTE-IDENTICAL to 6.1.0 (no class lost moving to JS strings). A
  jsdom harness executed the real module against the transformed DOM and
  compared class SETS on 1,629 elements vs pre-transform: zero
  differences.
- Pre-existing quirk preserved on purpose: bare `z-60`/`z-70` on three
  modals generate no CSS in stock Tailwind (they stack by DOM order);
  documented in the module header, not silently "fixed."

## V6.1.0 — Stage 6a housekeeping: self-hosted Tone.js + verifier hardening
(Shipped together with 6.0.2 on alpha; structural, no feature changes.)

- **Tone.js 14.8.49 self-hosted** as `/tone.min.js` (+ its MIT license file)
  — same minified UMD build as the cdnjs URL, sourced from the npm `tone`
  package. Last CDN runtime dependency removed; the SW caches it, so the
  bell sound engine now loads fully offline.
- **service-worker.js -> 1.8.0**: CACHE_NAME is now DERIVED from
  CACHE_VERSION — one bump busts the cache; the hardcoded-name footgun is
  gone. `/tone.min.js` added to CORE_ASSETS.
- **New verifier `npm run check:sw`** (build/verify-sw.mjs): CORE_ASSETS
  entries all exist on disk, every src/js module is cached, header version
  == CACHE_VERSION, CACHE_NAME is derived. Canary-tested.
- **verify-esm hardened**: unused import specifiers are now ERRORS (scan
  proved the 6.0.0 generator left zero; this keeps hand-maintained imports
  at that standard), and the TDZ audit gained an in-script reviewed-safe
  whitelist — the long-standing 02:state warning was reviewed (state.js
  imports nothing; no cycle possible) and whitelisted. Battery is now
  fully clean, zero warnings.
- **`npm run check:all`** runs the entire battery in one command.
- Module 02 split REVIEWED and re-parked: the file is 370 uniform DOM
  consts + export list, not a functional grab-bag; splitting would churn
  every module's imports for cosmetic gain, and Stage 6b (modal
  templating) will reshape it anyway. Do 6b first.

## V6.0.2 — Firefox sign-in fix (the popup must open from the click)
Google sign-in failed in Firefox since launch with the auth handler's
"missing initial state" error. Contrary to that message's usual diagnosis,
the codebase has NO `signInWithRedirect` anywhere — the cause was
`signInWithGoogle()` awaiting `startAudio()` (a Tone.js AudioContext
resume) and potentially `initFirebase()` **before** `signInWithPopup`. By
the time the popup opened, Firefox no longer treated it as user-initiated,
and under storage partitioning the degraded flow died in the auth handler.

- `signInWithGoogle()` (module 19) rewritten: click -> provider -> popup
  with **zero awaits in between** (the pattern proven on Tentacalendar's
  store.js v0.15.0, same stack). `startAudio()` is still *called* inside
  the click gesture — audio unlock needs that — but is no longer awaited
  before the popup. Cold-boot fallback (auth missing) now re-inits and asks
  for a second click instead of opening a popup outside the gesture.
- clock.html and dashboard-config.html audited: both already open the popup
  synchronously from the click. No change needed.
- Acceptance test (Firefox, default settings AND with Enhanced Tracking
  Protection set to Strict): click Sign In -> Google popup opens -> pick
  account -> popup closes, app signed in. No "missing initial state."

## V6.0.1 — Version correction + monolith removal (housekeeping)
The stage-2 modularization release was mislabeled **7.0.0** by a confused
session; the owner's numbering puts it at **6.0.0** (7.x is reserved for a
future major). Neither number was ever deployed, so no client saw 7.0.0.

- Every 7.0.0 reference corrected to 6.0.0 across code comments, module
  markers, HTML version spots, and docs. Current app version is 6.0.1.
- **`script.js` DELETED.** The 17,297-line generated monolith (pre-6.0.0
  concatenation output) was left in the tree when the conversion session was
  interrupted. Nothing referenced it; it duplicated every function in
  `src/js/`. Must also be deleted from the GitHub repo — see ROLLOUT.md.
- Status modal: `'script.js (App)'` label -> `'App (src/js modules)'`.
- service-worker.js -> 1.7.1: **bug fix** — `CACHE_VERSION` (what the status
  modal reports) was left at '1.6.0' when the header went to 1.7.0; the two
  must now be bumped together. CACHE_NAME stays v8 (CORE_ASSETS unchanged).
- Comment-only z-bumps for the corrected app references: bell-engine 1.3.3,
  firebase-config 1.0.2, clock.html 1.6.2.

## V6.0.0 — Native ES modules (stage-2 modularization; owner-approved major)
The app's JavaScript is now real ES modules served directly from `src/js/`:
index.html loads `src/js/main.js` and the browser resolves the import graph.
**script.js is retired** — there is no generated JS file and no JS build
step; what you edit is what ships, and DevTools errors point at real files.

- 27 feature modules + new `src/js/state.js` + new `src/js/main.js` (29 total).
- `state.js`: the 103 variables that were assigned from more than one chunk
  now live on one exported `state` object (ES module imports are read-only
  bindings, so cross-module writes must go through a shared object). 1,543
  references rewritten `foo` -> `state.foo`, located by scope analysis, never
  regex. Everything else stays in its module, exported as live bindings.
  (`state.localSchedulePeriods` is the §4.6 pristine copy — relocated,
  semantics unchanged.)
- Import/export blocks were machine-generated from the resolved reference
  graph during conversion (tools kept in `build/`); they're maintained by
  hand from here on, enforced by the new battery.
- 239 raw `console.log` calls migrated to `safeLog.log` (debug logging now
  gated by PRODUCTION_MODE in 03-memory-management.js). warn/error untouched.
- New verification: `npm run check:esm` (import/export linker, read-only
  import enforcement, TDZ audit) replaces `check:js`; lint is now per-module
  no-undef, which catches any missing import. `build:js`/`check:js` retired
  (build-js.mjs is a tombstone). Tailwind content scan repointed at
  `src/js/**/*.js` — the rebuilt tailwind.css came out byte-identical,
  proving no class strings were touched by the conversion.
- index.html -> 6.0.0 (all three places); service-worker 1.7.0 (CORE_ASSETS:
  script.js out, all 29 modules in; CACHE_NAME v7 -> v8). bell-engine.js is
  UNCHANGED and still a plain script shared with clock.html. No Firestore,
  rules, or data-shape changes. Sibling surfaces untouched.
- Also fixed: `npm run lint` had become a silent no-op under ESLint >= 9.14
  (targets outside the config's base path are ignored with exit 0); it now
  runs from the repo root and was canary-tested to prove it fails on a real
  no-undef.

## V5.79.1 — Post-launch bug-fix pass (per-file versions from here on)
FROM THIS RELEASE FORWARD, files version independently — only files that
were actually edited get bumps. This pass: index.html -> 5.79.1 (its own
version now, in all THREE required places: <title>, the visible <h1>, and
the final comment line — a maintenance comment in <head> documents the
rule); script.js/App -> 5.79.1; bell-engine.js -> 1.3.1 (VERSION export
only). Everything else untouched and unbumped. Semver semantics per the
owner: z = fix/clarification, y = new feature, x = major shift with the
owner's sign-off.

Fixes:
- Version display was inconsistent (title tag 5.79.0, visible header
  5.69.2, final comment 5.69.2) — all three now match and must always.
- Dashboard link in the header pointed at the repo root; the page lives at
  signage/dashboard.html.
- Notifications toggle could read "Off" after the user granted permission.
  Root causes fixed: Safari's legacy callback-form requestPermission()
  returns undefined, so awaiting it read a real grant as a denial (now
  shimmed for both forms, with live Notification.permission as the source
  of truth); and permission granted at the browser level was invisible to
  the label (it now re-derives from live state on every refresh, on tab
  refocus, and on permission-change events where supported, with an
  explicit third "blocked" state).
- Emergency shift row: Clear All overflowed the card (row now wraps;
  button labels no longer break mid-word).
- "Create New Schedule" was wearing modal styling (own shadowed card with
  max-height) inside the Admin Zone card — restyled to match its sibling
  forms.
- "Add Bell to This Schedule" now names its target inline — the SHARED
  base schedule it will edit — updating live with the active schedule and
  reading "no shared schedule selected" when none is.
- Footer now shows HTML | App | CSS versions at a glance; tapping the line
  opens the status modal, which gains a File Versions section listing
  EVERY file in the deployment (local ones read live, sibling surfaces
  fetched and parsed — a stale-cached TV shows up here as a mismatch).
  Copy Report includes both sections.

## V5.79.0 — Status / health view
- Tap the version number in the footer (now dotted-underlined) to open the
  App Status modal: app version, service worker version (via the
  GET_VERSION message channel that's been in service-worker.js since v1.0),
  online/signed-in/admin state, active schedule and any emergency shift,
  device clock drift from v5.77.0's monitor, notification state, and bell
  counts — plus a Copy Report button. The support script becomes: "open the
  app, tap the version number, read me the screen." Read-only by design.

## V5.78.0 — Web notification backup ring
- Opt-in, per-device toggle ("🔕/🔔 Notifications") in the bell-list
  controls row. When enabled and the tab is HIDDEN, every ring also fires a
  system notification — the backup channel for throttled background tabs
  and silent audio failures. One hook inside ringBell() covers every ring
  path (scheduled, missed-bell recovery, queue timers, quick bells), and
  because callers check mutes before ringBell, notifications automatically
  respect mutes.
- Deliberate deviations from the original sketch, documented in the chunk
  header: per-device localStorage instead of cloud-synced preferences
  (Notification permission is inherently per-browser — a synced ON that
  follows you to a device that never granted permission is a toggle that
  lies), and hidden-tab-only firing (a visible tab already has audio +
  visuals; the OS popup would be noise). The toggle turns itself off if
  permission gets revoked at the browser level, and enabling fires a
  proof-of-life notification so teachers see what to expect.

## V5.77.0 — Device clock drift warning
- Bells ring on each device's LOCAL clock, so a Chromebook running four
  minutes slow rings four minutes late and the teacher blames the app. The
  app now measures each device's offset against Firestore server time
  (NTP-style midpoint estimate over a server-timestamp round trip, written
  to the user's own diagnostics doc — covered by existing rules, no rules
  change) on load and hourly, and shows a dismissible amber banner when the
  offset exceeds 45 seconds, telling the teacher exactly what to fix
  (system Settings -> Date & Time).
- Deliberate decisions, documented in the chunk header: WARN ONLY, never
  auto-correct bell times (correcting would fight the OS clock and any
  later fix of it); dismissal lasts the session, so a still-wrong clock
  re-warns on tomorrow's page load; every measurement failure is silent —
  a diagnostics feature must not generate its own support noise (15s
  timeout guards the round trip).
- The estimation math lives in bell-engine.js v1.3.0
  (estimateClockDriftMs) with unit tests covering both drift directions
  and invalid input (51 tests total).
- The latest measurement is kept in lastClockDriftMs/lastClockDriftAt for
  the Stage 5 status view.
- src/js/ housekeeping: the init/listeners chunk is now numbered 99 so
  future chunk insertions never rename it again; new chunk is
  23-clock-drift.js (25 chunks).

## V5.76.0 — Signage pages: shared engine, relative bells, shifts (full depth)
- NEW signage/schedule-utils.js — the single home for the logic behind all
  three TV pages (dashboard v1.6.0, dashright v1.1.0, dashclock v1.1.0),
  which each carried their own copy of getScheduleStatus + time helpers. A
  comment claimed the copies were "bit-for-bit identical"; verification
  showed dashright's had already drifted (cosmetically, this time — but the
  same rot pattern that bit clock.html semantically in v5.72).
- FIXED: the signage pages never resolved RELATIVE bells — they displayed
  the raw stored `time` field, so moving an anchor bell in the main app
  silently left every TV showing the old period boundaries. Effective
  periods are now resolved through the shared engine, corrupt/orphan bells
  keep their engine fallback times, and a unit test pins the exact
  stale-time scenario.
- NEW: the TVs now honor emergency shifts. Effective periods (shift +
  resolution) are computed at read time and memoized on (local date + shift
  seconds), so a shift appears on the next 1-second tick after the snapshot
  arrives and self-expires at the first tick past midnight — no refresh
  mechanism needed, since these pages already had live onSnapshot listeners.
- All three pages now load ../bell-engine.js + schedule-utils.js after
  firebase-config.js (load order matters and is commented in each head).
- tests/schedule-utils.test.mjs: 10 new tests (49 total across both suites);
  `npm test` now runs both.
- service-worker v1.6.0 / cache v7: schedule-utils.js precached.
- dashboard.html's three configRef.onSnapshot listeners were inspected and
  left alone — they're mutually exclusive branches (setup mode / shared
  config / URL params), not a bug.

## V5.75.0 — Edit audit log (shared schedules)
- Every meaningful admin change to a shared schedule now also writes an
  append-only entry to that schedule's edit_log subcollection: server
  timestamp, who (uid + display name), action, and details (before/after
  where the call site has both — enough to build one-click undo later).
  Sixteen mutation sites instrumented: bell add/edit/delete, linked edits,
  period delete, multi-add period/bell, schedule create/rename/delete,
  import (replace and merge), sound reassignment, bulk edit, and emergency
  shift apply/clear. Logging is fire-and-forget — a log failure can never
  block or fail the edit itself.
- New Admin Zone -> "View Edit History": last 50 entries for any shared
  schedule, all rendered fields escaped.
- firestore.rules: edit_log is append-only BY RULE — create requires admin
  (matching who can edit schedules), update/delete denied to everyone
  including admins; read requires sign-in so any teacher can answer "who
  moved 4th period?" themselves.
- Auth listener now records the signed-in display name for log attribution.
- Batch operations (multi-add, conflict resolution, sound reassignment,
  import-merge) write ONE summary entry to the active schedule rather than
  one per touched schedule — documented trade-off, per-target logging is a
  future refinement. Schedule DELETIONS log under the deleted doc's ghost
  subcollection (Firestore keeps it), so they're also echoed to console.
- Imports extended (serverTimestamp, query, orderBy, limit); src/js/ now has
  24 chunks: new 22-audit-log.js; init/listeners is 23.
- The lint step caught a scope bug in this very feature's first draft
  (undefined `time` at the delete-bell site) before it shipped — the
  guardrails guard their own author.

## V5.74.0 — Emergency schedule shift; day-type calendar parked
- NEW: Admin Zone -> "Emergency Schedule Shift (today only)". Pick a base
  schedule (or all shared schedules) and a +/- minute offset; one field
  (temporaryShift { seconds, date, setAt }) is written to the schedule
  doc(s). Every client's listener picks it up live; resolveAllBellTimes
  shifts the shared STATIC bells on its merged copies, so every relative
  bell anchored to them — shared or personal, on any teacher's device —
  ripples automatically. Teachers' pinned personal static times don't move.
  The stored schedule is never modified, edit modals never see shifted
  times, and the shift self-expires at the midnight recalculation because
  it's stamped with today's local date.
- PARKED: the v5.73.0 day-type calendar auto-switching. The school runs six
  schedules simultaneously across 50 teachers, so one school-wide "today is
  Schedule B" designation is the wrong model. The admin UI was removed
  before ever shipping and the auto-switch is hard-gated behind an enabled
  flag nothing can set. The pure resolver + tests stay; the revival design
  (teacher groups by grade/role -> per-group day-type mapping) is sketched
  in src/js/20-schedule-calendar.js's header.
- clock.html v1.6.0: applies shifts via the shared engine, and now refreshes
  its schedule data every 2 minutes — previously schedules loaded exactly
  once per page load, so TVs and classroom grids never saw ANY mid-day
  schedule change without a manual reload.
- old.html v2: ES5 shift support at every schedule parse point, plus a
  5-minute auto-refresh through the existing Refresh handler — the iPad
  wall clocks now track mid-day changes too.
- bell-engine.js v1.2.0: shiftTimeString + getActiveScheduleShiftSeconds
  (date-stamped, self-expiring); 4 new unit tests (39 total), including one
  pinning the static-anchor -> relative-bell ripple.
- src/js/ now has 23 chunks: new 21-emergency-shift.js; init/listeners is 22.
- KNOWN GAP: the signage/ pages (dashboard.html, dashclock.html,
  dashright.html) are not in this repo snapshot and do NOT yet apply shifts.
  If they display bell times, they need the same ~10-line engine check
  clock.html got. Flagged in ROLLOUT.md.

## V5.73.0 — Day-type schedule calendar (auto-switching)
- NEW: Admin Zone -> "Set Which Schedule Runs Which Day". Admins set a
  weekday default schedule (Sun-Sat) plus date exceptions (assemblies,
  testing days; an exception of "none" suppresses the weekday default for
  holidays). Stored at public/data/config/schedule_calendar — already
  admin-write/public-read under the existing rules, no rules change.
- Every client auto-switches to the day's designated shared schedule at app
  load, at midnight (rides the existing day-change detection in updateClock),
  and live when the calendar or schedule list changes. A teacher's manual
  dropdown pick wins for the rest of that day on that device, and the app
  never auto-switches anyone OFF a personal schedule. All five rules are
  documented at the top of src/js/20-schedule-calendar.js; resolution logic
  is pure, lives in bell-engine.js v1.1.0 (resolveCalendarSchedule +
  toLocalDateString — local-timezone on purpose; toISOString would resolve
  tomorrow's schedule every evening), and has 5 new unit tests (35 total).
- FIXED (build tooling): running the Tailwind CLI from any directory other
  than build/ silently produced an EMPTY stylesheet (Tailwind v3 resolves
  content globs from the CWD, not the config). Content paths are now
  absolute via path.resolve(__dirname), and `npm run build:css` self-checks
  the output (size + sentinel classes) and fails loudly instead of shipping
  an unstyled app.
- NEW: ROLLOUT.md — the one-time deployment checklist for the whole
  v5.70-v5.73 batch (repo files, Firebase rules steps with playground
  checks, build setup, and a 10-minute smoke test).
- src/js/ now has 22 chunks: new 20-schedule-calendar.js; init/listeners
  renamed to 21.

## V5.72.0 — Shared bell engine, script.js split, six latent bugs fixed
- NEW: bell-engine.js — the single home for the pure time/schedule math
  (escapeHtml, timeToSeconds/secondsToTime, formatTime12Hour,
  getDateForBellTime, getBellId, findNextBellIn, findBellAfter,
  calculateRelativeBellTime). Loaded via plain <script> tag by BOTH
  index.html and clock.html (same pattern as firebase-config.js). Covered by
  30 unit tests in tests/bell-engine.test.mjs (`cd build && npm test`).
- FIXED (clock.html v1.5.0): its local copy of calculateRelativeBellTime had
  silently DIVERGED from the main app — it was missing the V5.44.1
  anchor-selection logic (shared static bells for linked periods vs anchorRole
  bells for standalone periods), so TVs could anchor relative bells to the
  wrong bell. It now delegates to the shared engine; corrupt/orphan bells show
  their fallback time instead of being silently dropped from TVs.
- SPLIT: script.js is now GENERATED — the concatenation of 21 readable chunks
  in src/js/ (built by build/build-js.mjs; `npm run build:js`). The build is a
  pure concatenation verified byte-identical at split time, aborts on syntax
  errors without touching script.js, and `npm run check:js` detects direct
  edits to the generated file. See build/README-BUILD.md.
- REMOVED: the v4.05 IIFE that wrapped 15,000 lines (added back then to fight
  ReferenceErrors; in an ES module it provided no isolation and blocked the
  split). Verified safe before removal: zero name collisions between the 241
  IIFE-scoped and 531 module-scoped declarations. Unwrapping also FIXED a
  latent bug class: pre-IIFE code (e.g. unskipBell) that called IIFE-scoped
  functions (showUserMessage, updateClock, updatePipWindow) threw
  ReferenceErrors whenever those paths ran.
- FIXED six more pre-existing latent ReferenceErrors found by lint
  (`npm run lint`, new): closeAllConflictModals referenced a nonexistent
  linkedEditModal (now confirmLinkedEditModal); executeAddPersonalBell
  reset a long-deleted form, logging a bogus error on every successful add;
  converting a relative bell to static crashed on an undefined
  calculatedTime (now resolved from the anchor + offset); the multi-period
  visual preview change handler called a nonexistent handleVisualSelectChange
  (now updatePeriodVisualPreview); the bulk-edit custom-text path called a
  nonexistent openCustomTextModal (now follows the standard
  currentVisualSelectTarget + modal pattern).
- service-worker v1.5.0 / cache v6: /bell-engine.js added to CORE_ASSETS.
- DOCS: build/README-BUILD.md rewritten around The Two Build Rules; warning
  banners added to the tops of script.js and tailwind.css; README updated.

## V5.71.0 — Self-hosted compiled Tailwind (replaces Play CDN)
- index.html now loads a static, self-hosted /tailwind.css (~30KB minified)
  instead of the cdn.tailwindcss.com runtime JIT (~380KB script that
  recompiled styles in the browser on every page load, and took the whole UI
  down with it whenever the CDN hiccuped). The inline tailwind.config
  (fontFamily) moved to build/tailwind.config.js.
- New build/ folder: tailwind.config.js, input css, package.json, and
  README-BUILD.md documenting the one rule that matters — if you use a
  Tailwind class that has never appeared in index.html or script.js before,
  run `npm run build` in build/ and commit the regenerated tailwind.css.
- Coverage was verified by extracting all 442 class tokens used across
  index.html and script.js and checking each against the compiled output.
  Only z-60/z-70 were absent — and those aren't in Tailwind's default scale,
  so the Play CDN never generated them either (four modals were stacking by
  DOM-order luck). styles.css v2.6 now gives those modals explicit z-indexes.
- service-worker v1.4.0 / cache v5: /tailwind.css joined CORE_ASSETS;
  cdn.tailwindcss.com removed from EXTERNAL_ASSETS and the opaque allowlist.
- PiP pop-out styling is unaffected: it copies document.styleSheets
  generically, and the same-origin compiled sheet copies cleanly (its
  cssRules are readable, unlike a cross-origin sheet).

## V5.70.0 — Security & offline hardening (audit pass)
- SECURITY: Added a real escapeHtml() utility (escapes & < > " ') and applied it
  to every user-controlled string interpolated into innerHTML: period names,
  bell names, schedule names, custom icon text, uploaded file names/nicknames/
  owners, sound URLs, and the delete-audio confirmation list. The previous
  escaping only handled double quotes, so a bell or period named with an HTML
  tag would execute script in every faculty member's browser via schedule sync.
  data-* attributes written through escapeHtml round-trip correctly when read
  back via .dataset (the parser decodes entities), so mute/skip/edit lookups
  keyed on raw names still match. ringBell()'s highlight querySelector now
  escapes for CSS-selector context instead of HTML context.
- SECURITY: Tightened firestore.rules (see firestore.rules comments): user data
  is now owner-only except personal_schedules (which old.html reads via
  unauthenticated REST and share-code following requires); share codes can only
  be created with your own uid as ownerId and only revoked by their owner or an
  admin (previously any authenticated user could delete anyone's code).
- OFFLINE: service-worker v1.3.0 — external CDN assets (Tailwind, Tone.js,
  fonts) are now actually precached (the EXTERNAL_ASSETS list existed but was
  never used), opaque CDN responses are runtime-cached from an allowlist, and
  ellisBell.mp3 joined CORE_ASSETS. Cache bumped to v4.
- CLEANUP: ~280 lines of in-file release notes moved from the top of script.js
  to this CHANGELOG.md. manifest.json theme_color updated to Carolina Blue
  #4B9CD3 (was still indigo #1d4ed8, out of sync with index.html since 5.69.1).

## V5.69.4 — PiP broadcast toggle fix
- Removed the broadcast toggle from the Picture-in-Picture popup. The toggle
  was being deep-cloned into the PiP from the main page's #quickBellControls,
  but the cloned button's inline onclick="toggleBroadcastMode()" referenced a
  function that doesn't exist in the PiP window's scope — silently no-op. Also
  created a duplicate-ID conflict with the main-page toggle.
- Broadcast sync still works as expected via the main-page toggle. The PiP is
  meant for at-a-glance bell display, not configuration.
## V5.69.1 — Carolina Blue palette — foundation pass (Tier 2 of audit, part 1 of ~3)
- Light/dark theme objects now use Carolina Blue hues instead of
  Tailwind blue-600/blue-400:
    Light accent: #38759E (Carolina Deep, WCAG AA-compliant on white at 4.99:1)
    Dark accent:  #8FC3E8 (Carolina Sky, excellent contrast on dark at 9.41:1)
    Bold accent:  #4B9CD3 (canonical Carolina Blue, used for large surfaces)
- Added --theme-accent-bold custom property for buttons/headers/backgrounds
  where contrast requirements are relaxed (large text / non-text UI).
  Existing --theme-accent remains the text-safe variant.
- Visual cue default background: 18 instances of #4338CA (indigo) replaced
  with #4B9CD3 (Carolina). Audited in context; all were "default bg color
  for custom-text visual cues" — not semantic, just a leftover default.
NOTE: This is the *foundation* of Tier 2. Tailwind class replacements
(blue-500 → theme-accent-bold, etc.) and the other files (clock.html,
dashboard.html, old.html, manifest.json) come in 5.70.0 and 5.71.0.
## V5.68.0 — Inline rename button for discoverability
- Added a pencil-icon button next to the schedule title in the main view.
  The admin-rename capability already existed (in the Admin Zone since v4.91),
  but was undiscoverable. The new inline button dispatches to the existing
  handlers: openRenameSharedScheduleModal() for admins (handles both shared
  and personal schedules), handleRenamePersonalSchedule() for authenticated
  non-admins with a personal schedule selected.
- The inline button mirrors the enabled state of the existing two rename
  buttons — no new permission logic, just a more findable entry point.
- Hidden in kiosk mode via the existing .kiosk-hide class.
## V5.67.0 — Audit pass — versioning cleanup + shared config + dead code removal
- REMOVED: CLOCK_VERSION and DASHBOARD_VERSION constants (stale cross-references).
  Each sibling file (clock.html, dashboard.html, dashboard-config.html) now
  tracks and displays its own version. index.html footer updated to match.
- REMOVED: Inline firebaseConfig declaration. Now read from window.firebaseConfig
  (defined in shared firebase-config.js). Consumers: index.html loads it before
  script.js; clock/dashboard/dashboard-config load it before their init logic.
- REMOVED: Dead functions — checkQueueUntilBell (never called outside definition),
  findPeriodAnchorBell (same), plus already-commented-out flattenPeriodsToBells
  and handleRelativeTimeChange blocks.
## V5.66.3 — Time Format Fixes & Theme Improvements
- FIX: Schedules with HH:MM times (without seconds) now work correctly
  - Root cause: setHours() with undefined seconds created Invalid Date, breaking countdown
  - Fixed in: updateClock(), isSafeToCleanup(), getDateForBellTime()
- NEW: Auto-migration normalizes HH:MM -> HH:MM:SS on schedule load (admins fix shared, users fix personal)
- Fixed bell item hover in dark mode (white-on-white issue)
- Added --theme-bg-hover and --theme-border-light CSS variables
## V5.66.2 — Theme & Bell Editing Fixes
- Fixed dark mode: visual cue container now uses theme variable
- Fixed light mode contrast: darker secondary text colors for readability
- Fixed shared bell sound editing:
  - ALL users can now change sound (creates personal override, only affects their room)
  - Sound dropdown enabled by default for everyone
  - Admins see "Override for all users" checkbox to optionally push to shared bell
  - Non-admins don't see checkbox (their changes are always personal)
- Added CSS variables for visual background, button colors
## V5.66.1 — Broadcast Toggle Fix

## V5.58.9 — Fixed relative bell detection to use correct property structure
- Relative bells use bell.relative object, not bell.relativeToAnchor
- Two anchor types: parentBellId (direct) or parentPeriodName+parentAnchorType (period anchor)
- Period anchor references (parentPeriodName) check if target period has matching anchor bell
- Properly copies bell.relative object instead of wrong properties
## V5.58.8 — Properly detect and exclude orphaned relative bells
- Relative bells whose anchors aren't in the import are now detected and excluded
- First pass collects all bellIds present in the import
- Bells with relativeToAnchor pointing to missing anchors are skipped
- Empty periods (all bells orphaned) are excluded from import
- Period and bell counts now reflect actual importable content
- Orphaned relative bells shown prominently in "Will Not Be Imported" section

- Enhanced error messages to include the period name of the blocking bell
- Error now shows: bell name, period name, and time (e.g., "Period Start" in "1st Period" at 8:00 AM)
## V5.57.1 — Fix personal period bells not editable
- BUG FIX: Personal period anchor bells (fluke bells) were showing "Only admin can change" message
- Root cause: handleEditBellClick had no else clause for custom bells, so time input stayed locked
- Added else clause to properly enable time editing for all custom bells (type !== 'shared')
- Users now have full control over their personal period anchor bells
## V5.54.6 — UX improvements

- Backup now includes bellOverrides (shared bell customizations)
- Restore now restores bellOverrides and shows count in confirmation
## V5.46.4 — Fix Shared Bell Sound Overrides to Sync Across Devices
- Sound overrides for shared bells now save to Firestore (bellOverrides) instead of localStorage
- Firestore overrides now take priority over localStorage during rendering
- This ensures changes to shared bell sounds sync across all your devices
## V5.46.3 — Fix ESC Key Handler Reference Error
- Fixed reference to deleted 'renamePeriodModal' that was causing JavaScript errors
- Changed to correct 'edit-period-details-modal' with proper form reset

- Both full-size and icon previews support custom backgrounds
## V5.45.1 — Fix period visual override backup/restore
- Fixed key format: uses hyphen (-) not colon (:)
