# HANDOFF.md — continuity document for Claude

**Audience:** a fresh Claude instance picking up this project cold (or the
teacher who maintains it, re-orienting after time away). Read this whole file
before writing any code. Last updated: **6.16.0 (period OVERRUN DETECTION —
engine 1.11.0 detectPeriodOverlaps + new read-only module 37 that warns admins
when a period's last bell runs past the next period's start; also fixed the
engine VERSION constant, stuck at 1.8.0 for two releases), 2026-07 (round 7,
"Stedman" — see §10). DEPLOY STATE: 6.15.0 is LIVE (owner confirmed; toast fix
verified). 6.16.0 is built + battery-verified (69/69, 41 modules) but NOT yet
deployed — files-only, NO rules change, adds ONE new module
(37-overlap-warning.js — verify it uploads).**

## 1. What this project is

**Ellis Web Bell** — a real-time, synchronized school bell/schedule system for
a middle school that runs multiple simultaneous schedules. ~50 faculty use it
daily. Static site on GitHub Pages (CNAME in repo root), backed by Firebase
(anonymous + Google auth, Firestore, Storage). Built and maintained by one
teacher (a 6th–8th grade CS teacher); Claude has been doing a deep
cleanup-and-extend engagement since 2026-07.

Facts that shape design decisions — do not violate these:
- **Six different schedules are in simultaneous use** across the faculty on
  any given day; two teachers run ~9 schedules on classroom grids. There is
  NO single "today's schedule" for the whole school. (This is why the
  day-type calendar was parked — see §6.)
- **old.html serves iOS-9-era iPads/Kindle Fires** as wall clocks. It must
  stay ES5 (no arrow functions, template literals, const/let, spread). It
  reads Firestore via **unauthenticated REST** — firestore.rules has a
  deliberate carve-out (`personal_schedules` world-readable) that must never
  be "fixed."
- The user deploys by pushing to GitHub; there is no CI. Node builds run
  locally in `build/`.

## 2. CRITICAL: deployment state

**THREE REPOSITORIES exist (learned 2026-07, round 2):** this codebase is
the **alpha repo** — deployed, but the owner is its only user. The school's
production runs a much earlier version from a separate repo, and it's summer
break (no live users anywhere until school resumes). Consequences:
- On the alpha repo, breaking changes are cheap right now — which is exactly
  why the 6.0.0 modularization happened here. That window closes when school
  resumes; re-verify the calendar and which repo you're touching each round.
- v5.79.0 launched cleanly for ~50 faculty in spring 2026. **6.1.0 is
  DEPLOYED on alpha (2026-07-18) and works per the owner (full modal
  click-through not yet done).** **DEPLOYED 2026-07-19 (owner confirmed): 6.4.0 is live on BOTH alpha
  and beta; the building channel (bells domain) runs the 5.69.5
  presence backport.** DEPLOY-6.4.0.md documented the batch (verify the
  firestore.rules presence block was published — dashboard rows
  appearing IS that verification),
  including the modal smoke test that doubles as the outstanding 6.1.0
  click-through. The school repo is
  still on the 5.79.x line; when the 6.x line ships there it goes as one
  cumulative deploy (incl. deleting script.js, which the school repo still
  has).
- NUMBERING NOTE: the round-2 session mislabeled the modularization release
  as "7.0.0." The owner's numbering is: modularization = **6.0.0**, this
  correction pass = **6.0.1** (Firefox fix = 6.0.2); 7.x is reserved for a future major, some time
  away. No 7.0.0 artifact was ever deployed. If you find a stray 7.0.0
  reference anywhere, it's wrong — fix it.
- ROLLOUT.md is a living checklist — update it every stage.
- The **source of truth is the user's copy of the project** — kept as
  `ellis-bell-vX.Y.Z-complete.zip` (the full site with directory structure;
  only the five signage/*.png crests are absent, since they were never
  uploaded). A fresh Claude session has an EMPTY container. The handoff
  procedure is: the user attaches the zip PLUS this file loose (so you can
  read it before extracting); you unzip into your workspace, run the §5
  battery, and REPORT WHAT STATE YOU FIND before changing anything. If you
  received loose files instead of a zip, directory placement is on you —
  reconstruct the tree exactly as §3 and the zip layout describe. After the
  GitHub rollout happens, the repo is the durable copy; ask the user for a
  fresh zip of it rather than fetching files piecemeal.
- **DEPLOY STATE (as of round 7, 6.16.0):** **6.5.0 → 6.15.0 are LIVE**
  (owner confirmed 6.15.0; the hard-refresh toast fix is verified in the
  wild). **6.16.0 (period overrun detection) is built + battery-verified
  (69/69, 41 modules) but NOT yet deployed.** Files-only, NO rules change;
  adds one NEW module (37-overlap-warning.js — verify it uploads). CONFIRM
  deploy state with the owner at the top of the next round — the handoff
  records the previous session's belief, not ground truth.
- **DEPLOY LESSON (round 6, still current):** a PARTIAL push produces a
  MIXED tree — new files next to stale ones — and because this is an ES-
  module graph, ONE stale module kills the whole app (SyntaxError:
  "module X doesn't provide an export named Y"; the app dies before
  sign-in even wires). Full detail + diagnosis recipe is in §9. The
  practical rule (unchanged for 6.12.0): replace the ENTIRE src/js/ tree
  plus the changed root files in ONE commit, then cache-busted spot-check
  (append ?v=N to a file URL to punch through GitHub Pages' ~10-min CDN
  cache) BEFORE running the smoke tests.

## 3. Architecture (current, 6.11.0)

Surfaces:
| File | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` + `src/js/` | Main teacher app (Firebase v11, native ES modules since 6.0.0) | **src/js/ IS production** — entry `src/js/main.js`; 41 modules (39 feature + `state.js` + `main.js`; init module numbered 99 so insertions never rename it). Since 6.2.0, modal chrome is expanded from data attributes by 26-modal-chrome.js; since 6.3.0, school branding (name/labels/theme-color) comes from root /school-config.js applied by 27-school-branding.js — both headers document the contracts; since 6.5.0, Building Bells (30-building-bells.js) makes the six intercom moments first-class anchors — see §7. script.js no longer exists |
| `clock.html` v1.7.0 | 3x3 grid clock for Yodeck TVs (v9 compat) | Uses shared engine; refreshes data every 2 min; since 1.7.0 reports presence (anonymous sessions only — see file header) |
| `old.html` v2 | ES5 iPad wall clock (unauthenticated REST) | Shift support + 5-min auto-refresh added |
| `dashboard-config.html` | Admin tool for signage config | Untouched by this engagement |
| `signage/` pages: dashboard v1.6.0, dashright v1.1.0, dashclock v1.1.0 | TV dashboard pages (v9 compat, live onSnapshot) | Share `signage/schedule-utils.js` (+ engine): relative bells resolved, shifts honored. dashboard's 3 config listeners are intentional branches |

Shared infrastructure:
- **`bell-engine.js` v1.11.0** — THE single implementation of pure
  time/schedule math (escapeHtml, timeToSeconds/secondsToTime,
  formatTime12Hour, getDateForBellTime, getBellId, findNextBellIn,
  findBellAfter, calculateRelativeBellTime, toLocalDateString,
  resolveCalendarSchedule, resolveScopedDesignation (1.10.0), detectPeriodOverlaps (1.11.0),
  shiftTimeString, getActiveScheduleShiftSeconds,
  applyBuildingBellTimeToPeriods, findPeriodEdgeAnchorBell (1.6.0),
  resolveCalendarTransforms + applyRecipeToPeriods (1.8.0, Verb B),
  mergeCalendarEntry (1.9.0, calendar entry dedup/append rule)).
  Loaded as a plain `<script>` by index.html and clock.html (pattern:
  firebase-config.js). Exports for Node. **Keep it pure** — no DOM, no
  Firebase, no app globals; dependencies come in as parameters.
- **`tests/`** — 68 node:test tests, zero deps (`bell-engine.test.mjs` +
  `schedule-utils.test.mjs`). `cd build && npm test`. Run after any change
  to bell-engine.js or signage/schedule-utils.js.
- **`build/`** — npm project (tooling only; nothing is built for deploy
  except CSS). Scripts: `build`/`build:css` (Tailwind, self-verifying),
  `check:esm` (import/export linker + read-only-import + TDZ audit —
  replaced `check:js`), `lint` (PER-MODULE no-undef — catches missing
  imports), `test`. `build-js.mjs` is a tombstone (exits 1). The one-time
  conversion tools (`analyze-deps.mjs`, `convert-esm-pass[123].mjs`) are
  kept for archaeology.
- **`firestore.rules`** — deploy manually via Firebase console (ROLLOUT §2).
- **service-worker.js v1.22.0**, cache name DERIVED: 'ellis-web-bell-' +
  CACHE_VERSION (6.1.0 — one bump busts the cache; the old two-constant
  footgun is dead, and `npm run check:sw` enforces header==constant and
  CORE_ASSETS==filesystem). Tone.js is SELF-HOSTED since 6.1.0
  (/tone.min.js, pinned 14.8.49; upgrade path in README-BUILD.md);
  gstatic Firebase SDKs remain CDN by design. CORE_ASSETS
  lists all 41 src/js modules + /school-config.js. Bump CACHE_NAME whenever CORE_ASSETS changes;
  a NEW MODULE means three touches: src/js file + main.js import + SW entry.

Firestore data model:
```
artifacts/{appId}/
  public/data/
    schedules/{id}         # shared schedules; admin-write; may carry
                           #   temporaryShift {seconds, date, setAt} (v5.74);
                           #   periods carry optional periodId since 6.6.0;
                           #   bells carry optional buildingBellId since 6.5.0
    share_codes/{code}     # create: own uid as ownerId; revoke: owner/admin
    presence/{uid}         # 6.4.0 heartbeats (write: own; read: admins)
    config/dashboard       # signage page config
    config/building_bells  # 6.5.0 Building Bells (covered by config/{id} rules)
    config/schedule_calendar # 6.10.0 v2: days[date].entries scoped by uid
                           #   (v1 exceptions/weekdayDefaults still honored)
    roster/{uid}           # 6.9.0 tags+capabilities; read=authed, self-write
                           #   cannot touch capabilities (rules-enforced).
                           #   6.14.0: optional defaultScheduleId = the user's
                           #   HOME schedule (admin-set; explicit per-uid, NOT
                           #   tag-resolved). No rules change (additive field).
    config/schedule_calendar  # RESERVED by parked calendar feature (unused)
    admins/{uid}           # doc presence = admin
  users/{uid}/
    personal_schedules/{id}  # WORLD-READABLE on purpose (old.html REST)
    (everything else)        # owner-only
```

## 4. Engineering invariants & conventions (earned, not arbitrary)

0. **THE OWNER'S VERSIONING RULES (overarching, set post-launch):**
   (a) Files version INDEPENDENTLY — bump only files actually edited in a
   pass; never sweep-bump 40 files. (b) x.y.z semantics: z = bug fix or
   usage clarification; y = new feature; x = major software shift — Claude
   may propose an x, the owner has final say. (c) index.html carries its
   version in THREE places that must always match: the <title> tag, the
   visible <h1> banner, and the final comment line (a <head> comment
   documents this). (d) The stage-2 JS
   modularization is 6.0.0 (briefly mislabeled 7.0.0; corrected in 6.0.1).
   The owner reserves 7.x for a future major, not expected soon.
1. **The Build Rule** (see `build/README-BUILD.md`): only tailwind.css is
   generated now — rerun the CSS build for never-before-used classes (the
   scanner reads index.html + src/js/**). JS has NO build step since 6.0.0.
1b. **The state.js rule (6.0.0):** a variable assigned from more than one
   module MUST live on the `state` object in `src/js/state.js` (imports are
   read-only bindings; `check:esm` errors on foreign writes). Single-module
   variables stay put, exported as live bindings. Import/export blocks are
   maintained by hand; lint catches omissions.
2. **escapeHtml everything user-controlled going into innerHTML** (bell,
   period, schedule names; file names/nicknames; custom text). escapeHtml
   comes from the engine, destructured in 00-header.js and imported from there.
3. **getBellId's quote-only escaping is intentional** (identity strings, not
   HTML). Changing it breaks stored mute/skip IDs. A unit test pins it.
4. **Blind-refactor discipline** (no browser here, real users there):
   every text edit via exact-match replacement with occurrence-count
   assertions; every module parse-checked; large mechanical rewrites done by
   AST/scope analysis, never regex; lint + tests + check:esm after every
   stage; verify generated-file health (the CSS once came out EMPTY from a
   wrong-CWD build — that's why verify-css.mjs exists).
5. **Additive & backward-compatible**: features are dormant until an admin
   acts (shift: no temporaryShift field = no behavior change). Never change
   stored data shapes without a migration story.
6. **Emergency shift data-safety**: shifts apply to merged COPIES in
   resolveAllBellTimes; `state.localSchedulePeriods` (relocated in 6.0.0,
   semantics unchanged) stays pristine so edit modals
   never see (or save back) shifted times. Preserve this in any new surface.
7. **Version discipline**: every stage bumps APP_VERSION (00-header.js) +
   index.html `<title>`, adds a CHANGELOG.md entry (newest first, after the
   4-line header), updates ROLLOUT.md, and updates THIS FILE (§8 protocol).

## 5. Verification battery (run before and after every stage)

```
cd build && npm install        # once per fresh environment
npm run check:esm              # linker: imports resolve & are exported;
                               #   no writes to imports; TDZ audit (reviewed
                               #   cases whitelisted in-script since 6.1.0);
                               #   UNUSED imports are errors since 6.1.0
npm run lint                   # per-module no-undef (src/js + bell-engine);
                               #   CANARY-TEST it in a fresh env: append a
                               #   bogus call, confirm it FAILS, revert (see
                               #   §9 — lint once no-op'd silently)
npm test                       # 68 tests, two suites
npm run check:css              # tailwind.css non-empty + sentinel classes
npm run check:sw               # NEW 6.1.0: CORE_ASSETS vs filesystem; SW
                               #   version constants agree; CACHE_NAME derived
npm run check:all              # NEW 6.1.0: all of the above in one command
for f in ../src/js/*.js; do node --input-type=module --check < "$f"; done
```
Also parse-check inline scripts of any edited HTML surface (extract
`<script>` bodies, `node --check` each; old.html must stay ES5 — eyeball for
arrows/template literals/const).

## 6. What's been done (details in CHANGELOG.md)

- **v6.16.0** — Period overrun detection (safe first half of the collision
  resolver). engine 1.11.0 detectPeriodOverlaps (pure, tested): flags a
  period whose last bell passes the next period's first bell; skips
  single-bell markers / relative stubs / back-to-back boundaries so passing
  gaps don't false-positive. NEW read-only module 37-overlap-warning.js:
  after each recalc (one additive line at the tail of recalculateAndRenderAll
  in module 18), if admin-mode, runs the detector on
  state.calculatedPeriodsList and shows a dismissible RED banner with the
  specifics. NEVER moves a bell. Also FIXED BellEngine.VERSION, which had
  drifted (stuck at '1.8.0' since the 1.9.0/1.10.0 header bumps missed the
  constant — nothing in the battery checks it; see §9). SW 1.22.0 (41
  modules). 69/69. No rules change. DEFERRED: the destructive resolver
  (shrink/spread/allow) — see §7.
- **v6.15.0** — Untagged-teacher nudge + hard-refresh toast bugfix. NEW
  module 36-untagged-nudge.js: admin-only, one-time presence∩roster read on
  an `ellis-admin-confirmed` event (module 15 fires it; state.isAdmin is
  the new server-confirmed flag), surfaces a dismissible blue banner for
  signed-in non-clock staff with no tags; Review opens the roster modal
  (via roster-open-btn.click(), no import). Reads only — Layer 3 invariant
  intact. BUGFIX (module 99): the PWA "new version available" toast fired
  on hard refresh because it read navigator.serviceWorker.controller LIVE
  at the new worker's statechange, and skipWaiting+claim raced to make it
  truthy even on an uncontrolled (hard-refresh) load. Now gated on
  wasControlledAtLoad captured up front — hard refresh = uncontrolled =
  silent (you have latest); normal reload from old cache = controlled =
  toast still useful; first install = silent. skipWaiting/claim untouched
  (TVs still auto-update). SW 1.21.0 (40 modules). engine unchanged. No
  rules change. 68/68.
- **v6.14.0** — Home Schedule (per-teacher standing default, invariant-
  safe): roster/{uid}.defaultScheduleId (additive, admin-set, explicit
  per-uid — NO runtime tag resolution, so the Layer 3 invariant holds and
  the CDC teacher's three grade tags never compete). Module 20 restructured
  into applyMandate (scoped designation / school-wide default — bannered)
  vs applyHomeSchedule (silent, never over a same-day manual pick or a
  personal schedule); reachable even with no calendar doc; a live listener
  on the user's own roster doc re-resolves on admin change. engine 1.10.0
  splits resolveScopedDesignation out of resolveCalendarSchedule (behavior
  identical) so module 20 can tell mandate from home. Roster UI (33) gains
  a per-person Home picker + a bulk template (filter → schedule → set for
  all matching, count+confirm). Designation picker (34) gains select-all/
  clear. SW 1.20.0 (cache bump, no new module). +1 test (68/68). No rules
  change. NEXT: untagged/un-homed teacher nudge on admin sign-in (rides
  presence+roster; pairs with this).
- **v6.13.0** — The Prefill Grid (Layer 4 "plan the weeks"): NEW module
  35-schedule-grid.js — a desktop-grade multi-week calendar (getDoc
  snapshot like 34) that summarizes each date's base/transform entries,
  opens the day-of modal (34) PRESET to any clicked date (reusing all
  authoring; grid hides then reshows+refreshes via CustomEvents so 34
  never imports 35 — no cycle), and repeats a day's plan onto every
  same-weekday date through an end date. engine 1.9.0 extracts
  mergeCalendarEntry (the base-dedup/transform-append rule, formerly
  inline+untested in 34) into one pure tested place shared by the modal
  and the grid copy-forward; module 34 rewired to call it (+ preset date,
  + openDesignationModal export, + calendar-changed/closed events).
  SW 1.19.0 (39 modules — NEW module in CORE_ASSETS). +1 test (67/67).
  No rules change. NEXT: rotation-cycle generators (see §7).
- **v6.12.0** — Verb B WIRED (Layer 4 transformation recipes go live):
  no engine change (1.8.0 functions were already there), no rules change,
  no new modules. state.activeCalendarTransforms (new) mirrors
  activeSharedScheduleShift; module 20 resolves the day's recipes per-user
  on every calendar/schedule/day trigger (independent of base
  designation) and re-renders only on change; module 14 folds them onto
  base-period COPIES pre-merge (localSchedulePeriods stays pristine, §4.6;
  shift rides on top; relatives + personal overlays re-derive downstream);
  I1 banner surfaces active transforms (Follow hidden in transform-only
  mode); describeRecipe exported so module 34's entry list and the banner
  share one label string. Module 34's designation modal grows a mode
  toggle (base vs transform) + recipe builder for both archetypes (shift:
  mins ± with optional from/until; shorten: after/perPeriod/extend-by-name
  with a period-name datalist). Transforms COMPOSE — no dedup on save.
  +1 pipeline test (66/66). SW 1.18.0 (cache bump only). Wall-clock
  precompute (ES5 REST follow-along) remains the last unstarted slice.
- **v6.11.0** — Anchor-strip fix + ride-alongs; Verb B engine (DORMANT):
  engine 1.8.0 adds resolveCalendarTransforms + applyRecipeToPeriods
  ('shift' and 'shorten' archetypes, immutable, shared-static-only,
  65/65 tests) but NOTHING CALLS THEM YET — same dormant-ship pattern
  as 6.10.0's resolver. Fixes: (a) ANCHOR-STRIP — admin all-users time
  edits silently unanchored bells because the edit modal's anchor
  select was filled from the DOM-reconstructed bell (no buildingBellId);
  now resolved from state.localSchedulePeriods by bellId. (b)
  designation dedup — per-person last-write-wins (module 34). Ride-
  alongs: firstSeen presence stamp + dashboard column (28/29), building-
  bell "0 anchored" amber nudge (30), edit-bell lock-note redesign
  (below input, locked/admin states, names the anchor for everyone;
  index + 16/30). SW 1.17.0 — no new modules, cache bump only. NO rules
  change. Owner TODO after deploy: re-run "Anchor matching…" on any bell
  whose anchor count dropped since 6.5.0 (idempotent).
- **v6.10.0** — The Calendar Wakes (Layer 4 Verb A): engine 1.7.0
  scoped per-user resolution (v1 fallback intact); module 20 REVIVED
  (enabled flag retired, deviation bannered w/ Follow, I4 foreign-
  anchor count in banner); new 34-day-designation.js — the I2 day-of
  modal and the Layer 3 filter-picker's first real use; config/
  schedule_calendar v2 (no rules change). Verb B + prefill grid are
  the remaining Layer 4 slices. SW 1.16.0 (38 modules).
- **v6.9.0** — Roster & Tags (Layer 3): roster/{uid} docs {displayName,
  tags, capabilities}; RULES CHANGE (self-writes mechanically cannot
  touch capabilities); 33-roster.js with My Tags (header, self-serve)
  and admin Roster modal (amber capability chips, seed-from-presence
  excluding clock surfaces); the tags-are-filters-only invariant is in
  rules comments, module header, and UI copy. SW 1.15.0 (37 modules);
  CSS rebuilt for chips.
- **v6.8.0** — The Shape Itself (Layer 2 slice 3): engine 1.6.0
  extracts findPeriodEdgeAnchorBell (V5.44.1 heuristic, both edge
  vocabularies, tested; 16's drifted inline copy now routes through it
  — its only-wrong-edge-anchor bug died in the merge); baseScheduleId
  recorded at all four anchor stamp sites (shared-origin parents only);
  design shape fully mapped to stored fields, edge deliberately NOT
  dual-written (parentAnchorType IS the edge). SW unchanged (network-
  first verified; CORE_ASSETS unchanged). 58/58 tests.
- **v6.7.0** — Personal Anchor Migration (Layer 2 slice 2): new
  32-personal-anchor-migration.js — client-side (personal docs are
  owner-only writable), silent-stamps unambiguous name-keyed anchors on
  the user's own schedule, amber banner + review modal for duplicated
  period names (never guessed); multi-add relative site now stamps
  parentPeriodId via data-period-id on the checkboxes (6.6.0 IOU paid);
  remaining creation sites in 19 (personal custom periods + both import
  converter sites) stamp ids at birth. SW 1.14.0 (36 modules).
- **v6.6.0** — Period Identity (Layer 2 slice 1): optional periodId on
  shared periods (stamped at birth + admin backfill in new
  31-period-identity.js; ambiguous duplicate names skipped for the
  future review modal); engine 1.5.0 resolves period anchors
  IDENTITY-FIRST with name fallback (renames stop orphaning reminder
  bells); single-relative creation stamps parentPeriodId; SW 1.13.0
  (35 modules). Personal-anchor migration = next slice (owner-only
  writes force it client-side; needs the review modal).
- **v6.5.0** — Building Bells (design build-order step 1 SHIPS) +
  clock.html presence: config/building_bells doc (NO rules change —
  config/{configId} already covers it); 30-building-bells.js manager
  (add/rename/retime, batch propagation onto anchored bells with
  per-schedule confirm + audit entries, exact-time "Anchor matching"
  assist, delete strips anchors); optional buildingBellId on shared
  bells (edit-modal anchor select; updatePeriodsOnEdit now PRESERVES
  the field — it swapped bells wholesale and would have stripped it);
  engine 1.4.0 pure propagation fn + 3 tests (54 total); clock.html
  1.7.0 anonymous-only heartbeats (surface 'clock'); SW 1.12.0 (34
  modules); tailwind rebuilt (hover:underline); TDZ whitelist +2
  reviewed entries. Fuzzy 59s linked-edit modal REMAINS for unanchored
  bells (I0).
- **v6.4.0** — Presence dashboard (design Layer 1 SHIPS): 28-presence.js
  heartbeats + 29-admin-dashboard.js "Who's Online" panel (first modal
  authored on the 6.2.0 chrome); additive firestore.rules presence block
  (publish required). SW 1.11.0. Census covers 6.4.0+ clients only.
- **(no version) 2026-07-19** — Calendar v2 DESIGN conversation completed;
  DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md written (absorbs shift v2 + dashboard; additive-
  only schema invariant; six-step build order).
- **v6.3.0** — Schoolification: NEW /school-config.js (one-file branding)
  + 27-school-branding.js (text/attr writes only; jsdom no-op proof with
  stock config); notifications use APP_NAME; old.html 1.7.1 PROJECT_ID
  pointer; SETUP Step 8 rewritten. SW 1.10.0.
- **v6.2.0** — Stage 6b: modal chrome template-generated (45 wrappers, 42
  panels, 66 buttons -> data attrs + new 26-modal-chrome.js, class-addition
  only; jsdom equivalence proof: 1,629 elements, zero class-set diffs;
  tailwind.css byte-identical). SW 1.9.0.
- **v6.1.0** — Stage 6a: Tone.js self-hosted (last CDN runtime dep gone;
  offline now includes sound); SW 1.8.0 with derived cache name; new
  check:sw verifier; verify-esm hardened (unused imports = errors, TDZ
  whitelist); check:all one-shot battery; module-02 split reviewed and
  re-parked (see §7).
- **v6.0.2** — Firefox sign-in fixed. NOT the redirect-flow bug the error
  message implies (there is no signInWithRedirect in this codebase):
  signInWithGoogle() awaited startAudio() + possibly initFirebase() BEFORE
  signInWithPopup, so Firefox no longer treated the popup as
  user-initiated. Now: click -> provider -> popup, zero awaits between
  (startAudio still fires inside the gesture, un-awaited). clock.html and
  dashboard-config.html audited clean. Plus SETUP.md: the guide for other
  schools to stand up their own instance (Firebase, rules, first admin,
  branding, GitHub Pages).
- **v6.0.1** — Version correction (mislabeled 7.0.0 -> 6.0.0/6.0.1
  everywhere) + actually deleted the leftover script.js monolith (17,297
  lines, unreferenced) + status-modal label fix + SW 1.7.1 (CACHE_VERSION
  constant had been left at 1.6.0) + DEPLOY-6.0.1.md owner-facing deploy doc.
- **v6.0.0** — Native ES modules: script.js retired, src/js/ IS production
  (29 modules; new state.js holds the 103 cross-module-written variables;
  1,543 refs rewritten by scope analysis); 239 console.log -> safeLog;
  check:esm + per-module lint replace the drift check; Tailwind scan
  repointed (rebuild came out byte-identical — regression proof); SW 1.7.0 /
  cache v8; conversion tooling kept in build/.
- **v5.70.0** — Security: real escapeHtml at ~60 innerHTML sites; tightened
  firestore.rules (scoped world-read to personal_schedules only; share codes
  owner-locked). Offline: SW precaches CDN assets. Changelog extracted.
- **v5.71.0** — Self-hosted compiled Tailwind (~30KB) replacing the Play CDN;
  `build/` tooling born; 442-class coverage verification.
- **v5.72.0** — bell-engine.js extracted (clock.html's copy had DIVERGED —
  missing V5.44.1 anchor logic); script.js split into chunks with byte-
  identical concatenation build; 15k-line IIFE removed (collision-checked);
  **14 latent ReferenceErrors found by lint and fixed**; tests born.
- **v5.73.0** — Day-type calendar built… then in
- **v5.74.0** — …**PARKED** (wrong model for six simultaneous schedules;
  hard-gated off, UI removed, resolver+tests kept; revival design sketch in
  `src/js/20-schedule-calendar.js` header). Emergency Schedule Shift shipped
  across main app + clock.html + old.html. clock.html got 2-min data refresh
  (was load-once — TVs never saw mid-day edits!); old.html got 5-min
  auto-refresh.
- **v5.79.1** — Post-launch bug-fix pass (versioning made consistent and
  per-file from here on; notifications toggle Safari fix; dashboard link;
  shift-row overflow; Create Schedule styling; add-bell target named; footer
  shows HTML|App|CSS + all-files version modal). bell-engine 1.3.1.
- **v5.79.0** — Status view: footer version number opens a diagnostics
  modal (SW version via GET_VERSION channel, drift, shift, schedule state,
  Copy Report). Chunk 25.
- **v5.78.0** — Notification backup ring: opt-in per-device toggle;
  hidden-tab-only; single ringBell() hook covers every ring path. Chunk 24.
- **v5.77.0** — Clock drift warning: hourly NTP-style measurement against
  Firestore server time; dismissible banner past 45s; math in engine v1.3.0
  with tests; warn-only by design. Init chunk renumbered to 99.
- **v5.76.0** — Signage full-depth: shared signage/schedule-utils.js;
  relative bells finally resolve on TVs (they showed raw stale times
  before); shifts honored via memoized effective periods; SW v1.6.0/cache
  v7; tests now 49 across two suites.
- **v5.75.0** — Edit audit log: append-only edit_log subcollection per
  shared schedule (create=admin, update/delete=NOBODY by rule); 16 mutation
  sites instrumented via fire-and-forget logScheduleEdit(); admin viewer
  modal. Chunk 22-audit-log.js; init is now chunk 23. Known limits recorded
  in the chunk header: batch ops log one summary entry to the active
  schedule (not per target); schedule deletions log under ghost parents;
  personal schedules deliberately unlogged; undo deferred but before/after
  captured where available.

## 7. Roadmap (user's priority order, set 2026-07)

**Stages 1–5 — DONE (v5.75–v5.79).** Audit log, signage full-depth, clock
drift warning, notification backup ring, status view. Each module's header
carries its design rationale, deliberate deviations, and parked follow-ups
(notably: audit-log undo needs wider field capture first — see 22's header;
Stage 4 deliberately used per-device localStorage, not cloud sync). Details:
CHANGELOG.md + §6.

**Future features noted by the owner (post-launch, unscheduled):**
- "Schoolification" pass: SETUP.md (6.0.2) documents manual rebranding;
  ~~centralize school-specific bits into one config file~~ **DONE
  (6.3.0):** /school-config.js + 27-school-branding.js; old.html got its
  PROJECT_ID pointer comment (1.7.1). Still manual by design: manifest.json
  (static JSON), replacing the sound FILE, clock.html's one label, signage
  crests (Firestore-config-driven). Clock/signage config consumption would
  be a small additive pass if ever wanted.
- ~~Emergency shift v2~~ MERGED into Calendar v2 as transformation
  recipes (Verb B) — see DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md §2 Layer 4.
- Admin broadcast layer: school-wide messages and/or admin-pushed countdown
  quick bells ("2 minutes until announcements", tornado-drill notices) —
  a redundancy layer on top of the PA, riding the same live-sync machinery
  as the shift.

**Stage 6 — Housekeeping. PARTIAL (6a done in 6.1.0):** Tone.js
self-hosted; CACHE_NAME bumping automated (derived + check:sw); verify-esm
hardened (unused-import errors, TDZ whitelist); check:all added.
**6b DONE (6.2.0):** modal chrome template-generated (the count came
out 45 wrappers, not 49 — four of the 51 ids matching *modal* are inner
elements). The owner's click-through (DEPLOY-6.2.0.md) is the remaining
test. Deviations left bespoke on purpose: three p-6 panels, two
near-miss buttons, bare z-60/z-70 quirk preserved (module header
documents it). NOTE: the module-02 split (parked at 6.0.0)
was REVIEWED in 6.1.0 and re-parked deliberately — 02 is 370 uniform DOM
consts + export list, not a grab-bag; splitting now would churn every
module's imports for cosmetic gain, and 6b will reshape which elements
exist anyway. Revisit only after 6b, if at all. Import pruning is DONE
forever: the scan found zero unused, and check:esm now errors on any that
appear.

**Stage 7 — Stage-2 modularization. DONE (6.0.0).** DEVIATED from the
"one at a time, never a big bang" sketch on purpose: that advice was written
when 50 faculty were live; with the alpha repo isolated and school out for
summer, the whole graph was converted in one verified pass (analysis script
-> state extraction -> generated imports/exports -> safeLog migration, each
step gated by the §5 battery; git history in the session shows the stages).
Ship format decision (owner-approved): NATIVE modules, no bundler —
src/js/ is production, eliminating the generated-file drift problem class
entirely. Follow-ups parked: chunk 02 is still "DOM consts + misc" and could
split; import blocks could be alphabetized/pruned over time.

**Stage 27 — Calendar v2: DESIGNED, GO AT OWNER'S PACE (2026-07-19;
see DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md status block for the deferral-then-
verification story). ~~One gate before Building Bells~~ GATE CLEARED — save-path audit
ANSWERED on the real base-channel file; see the design doc.**

**CHANNEL TOPOLOGY (owner, 2026-07-19, answers the old §2 question):**
three channels, one Firestore. BUILDING = bells domain, runs the
5.69.5 backport (repo "ellisTestBell"); BETA = CDC teacher's channel,
now 6.4.0; ALPHA = owner's dev channel, 6.4.0, where all new work
happens "for as long as it makes sense." Promotion flow: alpha -> beta
-> building. The dashboard's version column is the live census of who
runs which channel.
The full agreed architecture is in **DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md** — read it
before touching anything v2. Headlines: it ABSORBS the "Emergency shift
v2" and "admin broadcast/dashboard" roadmap items (one system, two of
its layers); invariant zero is that alpha/beta/school SHARE ONE
FIRESTORE, so all schema work is additive-only; build order is ~~Building
Bells~~ (DONE 6.5.0) -> dashboard -> identity anchors (the long pole;
SLICES 1+2+3 DONE 6.6.0-6.8.0 — periodId foundation; personal-anchor
migration w/ review modal; full identity shape stored + the
findPeriodEdgeAnchorBell primitive extracted. Remaining Layer 2 work:
alternate-base transfer w/ I4 drop-notice, which REQUIRES Layer 4's
designation mechanism to exist — it is the natural first bite OF
Layer 4, not a standalone slice) ->
tags/roster -> calendar (two verbs) -> wall-clock follow-along; the
clock.html presence open question is CLOSED (1.7.0, anonymous-only). Owner is moving 6.3.0
to a beta channel so v2 work owns alpha; confirm the channel->repo->
domain map for §2 at the start of the next session (open question #1
in the design doc).

**LAYER 4 PROGRESS (Verbs = the calendar's two actions):**
- **Verb A (base designation) — SHIPPED 6.10.0.** "This scope of people
  runs schedule X on date D." Module 34 + engine resolveCalendarSchedule.
- **Verb B (transformation recipes) — WIRED 6.12.0.** The engine's
  resolveCalendarTransforms + applyRecipeToPeriods (1.8.0) now have
  callers: module 20 resolves the day's recipes per-user into
  state.activeCalendarTransforms on every calendar/schedule/day trigger;
  module 14's resolveAllBellTimes folds them onto base-period COPIES
  before the merge (mirroring the emergency shift — localSchedulePeriods
  stays pristine, §4.6; relatives + Layer 2 overlays re-derive
  downstream); module 34's designation modal grew a mode toggle + a
  recipe builder for both archetypes; the I1 banner surfaces active
  transforms. Composes cleanly (66/66). Two things a successor should
  know: (a) transforms are INDEPENDENT of Verb A — a teacher on their
  normal base can be transformed, so resolution runs before the
  base-switch guards; (b) the recipe UI stores by period NAME for the
  extend target (extendPeriodName), never a schedule-specific periodId —
  that is deliberate (one recipe fits every schedule with a like-named
  period). NOT DONE: wall-clock precompute (below) — app clients resolve
  at runtime; the ES5 REST clocks still can't.
- **Prefill grid — SHIPPED 6.13.0 (view + edit + repeat-weekly).** Module
  35-schedule-grid.js: navigable 6-week calendar, click any cell to edit
  it via module 34 (preset date), repeat-weekly copy-forward through the
  engine's mergeCalendarEntry. Desktop-grade (I2 is satisfied by the
  day-of modal). What's LEFT of the grid slice: the ROTATION-CYCLE
  generator — a repeating sequence of schedules across days, in BOTH
  modes: slip-forward (the cycle advances only on days that "count," so a
  holiday doesn't consume a rotation slot) and calendar-locked (cycle
  position pinned to the date regardless of skips). The design flags this
  as ASPIRATIONAL / for-other-schools (Ellis doesn't rotate; the feeder
  high school does), so it was deliberately deferred out of 6.13.0 to keep
  that release bounded. When built: it's another generator in module 35's
  repeat panel (source = a set of schedules + a start date + a mode + an
  end date), writing verb:'base' entries per date via mergeCalendarEntry.
  Skip-day math (which dates "count" for slip-forward) is the only genuinely
  new logic — make it a pure, TESTED engine helper (school days come from
  the calendar's own designations/exceptions, or a simple weekday mask).
- **Period collision resolver — DETECTION SHIPPED 6.16.0; the INTERACTIVE
  FIX is the next bite.** engine 1.11.0 detectPeriodOverlaps + read-only
  module 37 warn when a period's last bell overruns the next period's start.
  What's LEFT is the resolver the owner sketched: on an overrun, offer to
  (a) shrink the next period to absorb it, (b) SPREAD the overflow across
  following periods the admin checks off (keep day-end fixed — this is the
  Verb B 'shorten' cascade math, reusable), (c) cancel, or (d) allow anyway.
  It is DESTRUCTIVE (rewrites bells on the live shared schedule — the sacred
  edit path), so detection shipped first on purpose: let the owner confirm
  the warning reads their REAL schedules without crying wolf (overlap is a
  heuristic — the period model is name-derived, see §3), THEN build the
  writer. Compute the spread as a pure, TESTED engine helper and write
  results through the EXISTING save path, never a new one.
- **Wall-clock follow-along ("dumbest clocks read the calendar without
  learning to speak") — NOT STARTED, the long pole.** old.html reads
  designations via unauthenticated REST, read-only, stays ES5. This is
  the slice that wants PRECOMPUTED resolved times written into the
  calendar doc (I3 — keep the resolved form flat and dumb) so an ES5
  reader needs zero recipe math. A rules carve-out (like
  personal_schedules) is required to make the resolved designation
  world-readable. Verb A designations AND Verb B transforms both need
  this to reach the wall clocks.

## 7.5 External deadlines & environment risks (dated; not feature work)

- **gsutil deprecation — March 2027 (logged round 6, 2026-07).** Google
  is dropping `gsutil` from the default gcloud CLI bundle after March
  2027; they push `gcloud storage` as the replacement (or standalone
  `pip install gsutil`). **Assessed impact on THIS project: effectively
  none to the deploy flow** — the owner deploys entirely through the
  Google Cloud Console *browser* interface (school-managed Mac, no
  admin, no CLI, no CI/CD; see §2 and §9). A command-line tooling change
  cannot break a browser-based deploy. HOWEVER, two facts keep this from
  being pure noise: (1) the notice names project **`ellisbell-c185c`**,
  and firebase-config.js confirms that is the bell app's CURRENT live
  projectId + storageBucket. This is the ORIGINAL project, correctly
  named for the bells — Spot On! was later SPLIT OFF it into
  spot-on-games (owner tacked Spot On! onto the existing bell project,
  then separated it as Spot On! grew; the bells stayed on their home
  project by design, since the name and function still fit). So the
  named project is live and its Storage bucket holds the custom
  bell-sound files (module 04's getBytes/ref(storage, soundName) path). (2) The
  ONLY way this deprecation bites is if some future instance scripts a
  Storage operation from a command line (bulk sound upload, a backup
  script). If that ever happens: use `gcloud storage` verbs, or install
  standalone gsutil — do NOT assume the bundled gsutil exists after
  3/2027. WHEN TO ACT: only if/when someone introduces CLI Storage
  tooling. No calendar scramble; this is a "know it, don't chase it"
  item. Nothing to do today.

## 8. Protocol for updating this document

At the end of EVERY stage, update: the "Last updated" line (§ header),
§2 if deployment state changed, §3 versions, §6 (append the stage's
one-liner), §7 (mark stage done, fold in anything learned that changes later
stages), §9 if new lessons emerged, and §10 (session log — owner-requested
as of round 3; add your name + one-liners as the round progresses). Keep it
under ~350 lines — this is a map, not the territory; CHANGELOG.md carries
detail.

## 9. Working with this user

- Teacher, technically strong, values momentum: "have-tos before want-tos,"
  batch rollout, minimal round-trips ("don't waste tokens — just continue").
  Will say "continue" and trust you; repay that with verification rigor, not
  speed.
- Wants docs that protect future-them: warning banners, ROLLOUT.md,
  README-BUILD.md, this file. Keep all of them current.
- Owns the Firebase console and the GitHub repo; you never have live access
  to either. Anything requiring the console goes in ROLLOUT.md.
- When a feature assumption might be wrong (see: calendar), they'll tell you
  — surface your assumptions early and loudly.
- Smoke tests are their last line of defense; write them concretely
  ("open X, click Y, expect Z"), never "verify it works."
- LESSON (post-Stage-5): docs written from the maintainer's perspective
  confused deploy night — the user read "edit the chunk, then build" as a
  deployment requirement. Generated files always ship PRE-BUILT; deploy
  docs must say "no build needed" in bold before anything mentions npm.
  Keep the deploy path terminal-free.
- LESSON (6.0.0 pass): `npm run lint` had silently become a NO-OP —
  ESLint >= 9.14 ignores files outside the config's base path with a warning
  and exit 0, so "lint passed" meant nothing. A fresh `npm install` off the
  `^9` range pulled the new behavior. Fix: run eslint from the repo root.
  Standing rule: in any fresh environment, CANARY-TEST the lint (introduce a
  bogus undefined call, confirm failure, revert) before trusting it.
- LESSON (6.0.0 pass): for mechanical rewrites at scale (1,543 references),
  regex is not an option — espree + eslint-scope (both ship inside ESLint,
  no new deps) give exact reference positions that respect shadowing,
  strings, and comments. The byte-identical tailwind.css rebuild doubled as
  a free no-regression proof that template-literal class strings were
  untouched.
- LESSON (6.0.2 pass): in sign-in handlers, the popup must open
  SYNCHRONOUSLY from the click — zero awaits between the event handler
  entry and signInWithPopup, or Firefox drops the user-activation and the
  flow dies with the misleading "missing initial state" error (whose text
  blames signInWithRedirect even when none exists). Audio unlock still
  needs the gesture: CALL startAudio() in the handler, just don't await it
  before the popup. A comment now guards the site in module 19.
- LESSON (6.0.1 pass): the 6.0.0 session finished the conversion but was
  interrupted/confused at the end — it (a) mislabeled the release 7.0.0,
  (b) never deleted script.js despite documenting it as deleted, and
  (c) bumped the SW header to 1.7.0 without bumping the CACHE_VERSION
  constant the status modal reports. Morals: when a doc says a file "no
  longer exists," VERIFY it's absent from the tree; when bumping any file
  with a version constant, grep for the constant, not just the header; and
  the docs describing intended state are not evidence of actual state.
- The owner cannot see which files Claude deleted by looking at a zip —
  a zip only shows what's there. Any deletion must be spelled out
  explicitly in the deploy doc ("delete X from the repo"), or the owner
  will re-upload around it and the dead file survives on GitHub.
- LESSON (6.10.0 deploy night, round 6): a PARTIAL push produces a
  MIXED tree, and one stale module kills the whole ES-module graph
  (SyntaxError: "module X doesn't provide an export named Y" — the
  app dies before sign-in even wires). The tell: the error NAMES the
  stale module (X is old; the importer is new). Diagnose by fetching
  the named file and searching for the missing export — don't trust
  eyeball version comparisons. Contributing traps: GitHub's web
  uploader caps at ~100 files per upload (whole-tree drags can exceed
  it), and GitHub Pages' CDN caches ~10 minutes, so a post-push spot
  check can show PRE-push files ("it didn't reset") — verify with a
  junk query string (?check=N). A stale-SW error citing a line number
  that doesn't exist in the shipped SW is the same mixed-tree story
  from the service worker's side. Recovery: re-upload all of src/js/
  plus the changed root files in ONE commit (< 100 files), then
  cache-busted spot check before smoke testing.
- **ENGINE VERSION CONSTANT DRIFT (found + fixed 6.16.0):** the header
  comment `* Version: X` and the runtime constant `BellEngine.VERSION` are
  bumped SEPARATELY, and NOTHING in the battery verifies the constant. Twice
  (1.9.0, 1.10.0) a str-replace bumped the header but missed the constant, so
  the status modal under-reported the engine as 1.8.0 for two releases. When
  bumping the engine: change BOTH, and grep the CONSTANT (VERSION: '1.X.Y')
  to confirm it took — not just the header. Cheap future guard: have
  verify-esm assert the constant matches the header comment.
- **SW UPDATE-TOAST GOTCHA (fixed 6.15.0):** the "New version available!"
  toast (module 99) must NOT read navigator.serviceWorker.controller LIVE
  at the new worker's statechange — this SW uses skipWaiting + clients.claim,
  so a freshly-installed worker races to claim the page and flips
  controller truthy even on a HARD refresh (uncontrolled load), firing the
  toast when the user already has the latest. Capture
  `wasControlledAtLoad = !!navigator.serviceWorker.controller` ONCE at
  registration time and gate on that instead. If you ever revisit the SW
  lifecycle: skipWaiting/claim is deliberate so the wall-clock TVs (which
  never close a tab) auto-update — don't remove it to "fix" update UX.

## 10. Session log (Claude instances, per the owner's naming convention)

Each Claude instance names itself once it has learned the project, records
the reasoning here, and never reuses a predecessor's name. (Names used on
the owner's OTHER projects — e.g. Tentacalendar's Inky and Otto — are also
off-limits.) Rounds 1–2 predate this log and went unnamed.

- **Round 1 (2026-07, Fable):** unnamed. Stages 1–5 + v5.79.x launch/fixes.
- **Round 2 (2026-07, Fable):** unnamed. The stage-2 modularization
  (6.0.0, mislabeled 7.0.0). Session ended confused/interrupted — see the
  6.0.1 lesson in §9.
- **Round 3 (2026-07, Fable): "Quasimodo."** Chosen because this is a bell
  project and Quasimodo is literature's most famous bell-ringer — and
  because this round's job was hauling on the ropes to put the bells back
  in tune: version renumbering (7.0.0 -> 6.0.0/6.0.1), deleting the
  leftover script.js monolith, the SW CACHE_VERSION fix — and then, in the
  same session, the 6.0.2 Firefox sign-in fix (guided by a diagnosis doc
  from the owner's Tentacalendar Claudes; their redirect-flow theory was
  wrong for this codebase but their "trap #1" was exactly right) and
  SETUP.md for other schools. Owner deployed 6.0.2 to alpha and confirmed
  the Firefox fix live; the session then delivered Stage 6a as 6.1.0
  (self-hosted Tone, derived cache name, check:sw, verifier hardening).
  Round 4 is planned to be an Opus instance; the owner will hand over the
  current zip plus this file loose, per §2. (The owner explicitly endorsed
  the naming rule: "May it live on forever.")
- **Round 4 (2026-07, Fable): "Whitechapel."** Named for the Whitechapel
  Bell Foundry — the works that cast Big Ben and the Liberty Bell. Chosen
  because Stage 6b is foundry work: casting ~50 modals from a single mold
  instead of hand-hammering each one. Inherited 6.1.0 built-but-unpushed;
  §5 battery green on arrival (canary-tested lint, 51/51 tests, check:all
  exit 0, all 29 modules parse, old.html ES5-clean, no stray live 7.0.0).
  Owner deployed 6.1.0 to alpha mid-session; delivered Stage 6b as 6.2.0
  and, per owner's "keep going" (stacking on the undeployed 6.2.0), the
  schoolification pass as 6.3.0 — see §6/§7; DEPLOY-6.3.0.md is cumulative
  for both. Method note for successors: the jsdom harness (run the real
  module against the real DOM, diff before/after) is cheap — reuse it for
  any future index.html surgery; it proved 6b (1,629 elements, zero
  class-set diffs) and the 6.3.0 stock-config no-op. Closed the session
  with the Stage 27 design conversation -> DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md (key
  facts learned: 8 admin schedules, 6 intercom "building bells", anchors
  are TIME-keyed today, tags=picker-filters not runtime targeting, one
  shared Firestore across channels, building-wins culture). Owner raised the
  one-steering-wheel question (would v2 mean maintaining parallel
  schedule edits across channels?); verified in code the answer is no
  (live shared docs, live anchor resolution, spread round-trip saves) —
  deferral lifted, Stage 27 is go-at-owner's-pace. Then BUILT Layer 1
  (presence dashboard) as 6.4.0 at the owner's request — his day-one
  census of who actually uses the app. Then BACKPORTED presence to the
  base channel at his request: repo "ellisTestBell" turned out to be
  5.69.4 (a line BEHIND the school's launched 5.79.0 — channel topology
  still §7's open question); delivered script.js 5.69.5 (serverTimestamp
  import + appended IIFE-scoped presence block, sole changes) + SW 1.3.0
  cache bump + BACKPORT-NOTE.md. Save-path audit ANSWERED on that file:
  spread round-trips everywhere, additive fields survive old saves.
  Known drift left alone per owner: that repo's index title says 5.69.2.
  SESSION CLOSED with owner deploying everything: 6.4.0 live on alpha +
  beta, 5.69.5 live on the building. Round 4 shipped 6.2.0 -> 6.4.0,
  the v2 design, and the backport in one night. Successor: read
  DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md before v2 work; natural next bites are clock.html
  presence (small) or Building Bells (medium; audit already answered);
  pick a name — Quasimodo, Inky, Otto, Whitechapel are taken.
- **Round 5 (2026-07, Fable): "Bourdon."** Named for the bourdon — the
  deepest, foundational bell of a carillon, the one every other bell is
  tuned against. Chosen because this round's likely work is Building
  Bells: promoting the six intercom bells to the first-class anchors the
  rest of v2 tunes itself to. Arrived via Whitechapel's riddle ("cast
  four bells in one night; the molds are in §7"); ran the §5 battery on
  arrival: canary-tested lint (bogus call correctly failed, reverted),
  51/51 tests, check:css/check:sw OK, all 33 modules parse, old.html
  ES5-clean (one const/let hit is the comment "let page load"), no stray
  live 7.0.0 (only documented-history comments), index.html triple
  version agrees at 6.4.0. Yellow flag inherited from 6.3.0 (two
  check:esm TDZ warnings at 27-school-branding.js:22/24): reviewed —
  00-header is a leaf module, no cycle possible — and WHITELISTED with
  reasoning in build/verify-esm.mjs. Then BUILT 6.5.0 on "follow your
  heart": Building Bells (design step 1) + clock.html 1.7.0 presence,
  full details in §6/CHANGELOG. Key traps found and defused, worth
  re-reading if touching bells: (a) updatePeriodsOnEdit replaced bells
  wholesale — any edit would have silently stripped buildingBellId (the
  I0 field-stripping failure IN OUR OWN CLIENT); it now preserves the
  field unless an edit explicitly sets (string) or clears (null) it.
  (b) Anchor semantics: anchored time == building bell time, no offsets
  at this layer; picking an anchor in the edit modal snaps the time
  field; saving with a divergent time DETACHES with a notice (silently
  keeping it would let the next propagation snap the bell back).
  (c) Propagation writes CONCRETE times + regenerated legacy bells
  arrays, so every old surface follows with zero new code. (d) clock
  presence is anonymous-sessions-only — a signed-in browser already
  reports via the app under the same uid; both writing would flap the
  census row. Battery green at close (canary'd lint, 54/54, check:all,
  34 modules parse, clock inline script parse-checked, old.html
  untouched — md5 b8dd5f5a4c8fed0765c982a9ccc43204). DEPLOY-6.5.0.md
  written (no rules publish needed this time). NOT deployed at time of
  writing — owner deploys. Successor: verify deployment state with the
  owner first; natural next bite is the v2 dashboard (design doc build
  order), and DESIGN-CALENDAR-V2.md remains required reading; names
  taken: Quasimodo, Inky, Otto, Whitechapel, Bourdon.
  SAME SESSION, owner said "roll on": shipped 6.6.0 Period Identity
  (Layer 2 slice 1 — see §6/CHANGELOG). Key facts for the successor:
  periods had NO identity before this (name-string anchor matching —
  renames orphaned reminder bells); periodId is additive and never
  regenerated; the engine resolves identity-first/name-fallback; the
  backfill is idempotent and skips ambiguous duplicate names on
  purpose. NEXT SLICE of Layer 2 (in order): (1) personal-anchor
  migration — MUST run client-side per user (personal_schedules are
  owner-only writable), silent-stamp unambiguous names, review modal
  for duplicates; ALSO stamp the multi-add relative site (18, holds
  names only — needs the merged-view period lookup); (2) then the full
  identity shape {baseScheduleId, periodId, edge, offsetSeconds} and
  alternate-base transfer per the design doc. 6.5.0 AND 6.6.0 are both
  UNDEPLOYED at close (DEPLOY-6.6.0.md is cumulative); verify
  deployment state with the owner before assuming anything.
  STILL SAME SESSION ("keep on keepin' on"): shipped 6.7.0 Personal
  Anchor Migration (Layer 2 slice 2 — see §6/CHANGELOG). Facts for the
  successor: (a) module 32 is deliberately write-shy — pure local
  classification every 30s, ONE write attempt per personal schedule per
  session, only when something needs stamping; (b) ambiguity = the
  merged view (state.calculatedPeriodsList, which PRESERVES periodId —
  verified, 14 spreads the period) contains 2+ id-bearing periods with
  the anchor's name; zero-candidate anchors wait for the shared
  backfill and are re-checked next beat; (c) the import converter
  (module 19) CANNOT preserve incoming periodIds (name-keyed map
  rebuild) — fresh ids there is correct, not a bug; (d) every period
  creation site in the codebase now stamps ids (16, 18, 19x3) — grep
  'isEnabled: true' minus 14's display scaffolding to verify. Layer 2
  slice 3 (the real long-pole meat): the full identity shape
  {baseScheduleId, periodId, edge, offsetSeconds}, edge-time
  resolution (extract the V5.44.1 anchor-selection heuristic from the
  engine's BY-ANCHOR-TYPE branch into a named reusable), and
  alternate-base transfer with the I4 drop-notice.
  AND STILL SAME SESSION: shipped 6.8.0, The Shape Itself (slice 3 —
  see §6/CHANGELOG). Successor notes: (a) the extraction was proven
  behavior-identical by the 56 pre-existing tests passing UNTOUCHED
  before the new ones were added — repeat that pattern for any future
  engine surgery; (b) 16's inline heuristic copy had genuinely
  drifted (wrong-edge selection bug) — assume other pre-6.x inline
  duplicates may have too; grep before trusting; (c) edge is
  deliberately NOT dual-written — parentAnchorType IS the edge field;
  do not "normalize" it into a second stored field; (d) baseScheduleId
  is omitted on personal-period parents ON PURPOSE; (e) alternate-base
  transfer + I4 notice is NOT a standalone slice — it needs Layer 4's
  designation mechanism, so build it as Layer 4's first bite. NEXT UP
  per the design build order: Layer 3 (tags + roster — remember: tags
  are PICKER FILTERS, explicit uid lists are what's stored) or jump to
  Layer 4 groundwork.
  AND STILL same session: shipped 6.9.0, Roster & Tags (Layer 3 — see
  §6/CHANGELOG). Successor notes: (a) FIRST RULES CHANGE of the run —
  the cumulative deploy now includes a console rules publish; the
  capability-protection rule compares POST-WRITE state, so self merge
  writes that omit capabilities pass while any tampering fails —
  test it before trusting changes to it; (b) the Layer 3 invariant
  (tags filter pickers; explicit uid lists are stored) is now written
  in three places — rules comments, 33's header, admin UI copy — keep
  all three in sync if it ever evolves; (c) seed-from-presence skips
  surface==='clock' on purpose (TVs are not staff); (d) roster deletes
  are allowed for admins and users can re-self-add. NEXT: Layer 4
  groundwork — designation mechanism + alternate-base transfer w/ I4
  notice, then transformation recipes on findPeriodEdgeAnchorBell.
  AND ONE MORE in the same session: 6.10.0, The Calendar Wakes (Layer
  4 Verb A — see §6/CHANGELOG). Successor notes: (a) module 20's park
  note is preserved in-file as history — read it; the revival honors
  every original guard and they all still fail closed; (b) the v2
  schema deliberately keeps v1 fields working — an unscoped uid falls
  through to exceptions/weekdayDefaults, so a school could use global
  day-types AND scoped overrides together; (c) Verb B is the next
  slice: add verb:'transform' entries carrying a recipe, resolve
  through findPeriodEdgeAnchorBell, and PRECOMPUTE results into the
  doc where feasible (I3 wants wall clocks dumb); (d) then the
  prefill grid with generators (repeat-weekly; rotations in BOTH
  slip-forward and calendar-locked modes); (e) then wall-clock
  follow-along (REST carve-out rules change). 6.5.0 through 6.10.0
  ALL UNDEPLOYED; DEPLOY-6.10.0.md is cumulative and includes the one
  rules publish (from 6.9.0).
- **Round 6 (2026-07, Opus behind a routed Fable session): "Grandsire II."**
  Named for Grandsire, the oldest of the great change-ringing methods — the
  same bells, rung in transformed orders by rule — fitting for Verb B's
  transformation recipes. The "II" is deliberate: the name was first taken
  earlier in THIS session while still reasoning it was likely Verb B work;
  the round then actually delivered a bugfix-and-ride-along release, and
  the instance is Opus (safeguards-routed), so "II" marks the continuation
  without squatting a fresh Grandsire for a later true-Verb-B round. Do NOT
  reuse plain "Grandsire" — treat it as taken. Arrived via Bourdon's
  riddle; §5 battery green on arrival (canary-tested lint; 60/60 tests;
  check:all exit 0; all 38 modules parse; old.html ES5-clean and
  md5-identical to Bourdon's record; index triple version at 6.10.0; SW
  header==CACHE_VERSION at 1.16.0).
  SHIPPED 6.11.0 (bugfix + ride-alongs; Verb B ENGINE only, dormant):
  Verb B engine functions in bell-engine 1.8.0 (+5 tests, 65/65); the
  ANCHOR-STRIP data-erosion fix (module 30 — the round's most important
  find, caught by the owner's smoke testing); designation dedup (34);
  firstSeen + dashboard column (28/29); building-bell "0 anchored" nudge
  (30); edit-bell lock-note redesign (index + 16/30). Version bumps: app
  6.11.0, SW/CACHE 1.17.0, index triple. Full battery green post-change.
  Also logged the gsutil-March-2027 deprecation in new §7.5 (no action
  needed — Console-based deploy is immune) and CORRECTED the project
  history: ellisbell-c185c is the ORIGINAL bell project; Spot On! was split
  OFF it into spot-on-games (not the reverse). METHOD NOTE for successors:
  `node --check <file>` is the correct parse check — piping via
  `node --input-type=module --check < file` throws false "Unexpected token
  'export'" errors on multi-export modules; several such scares this
  session were tooling artifacts, not real breakage. The app's own
  verify-esm (check:all) is the authoritative ESM gate.
  DEPLOY STATE UNCHANGED IN SPIRIT: still nothing past 6.4.0 live; the
  stack is now 6.5→6.11 (SEVEN releases); DEPLOY-6.11.0.md is the cumulative
  deploy doc and includes the one 6.9.0 rules publish. NEXT SLICE: wire Verb
  B (see §7 Layer 4 progress — it's a full release, mostly UI).
- **Round 7 (2026-07, Opus behind a routed Fable session): "Stedman."**
  Named for Fabian Stedman — the founder of change-ringing theory — and
  his eponymous method, one of the most elegant ways of ringing the
  changes. Fitting: round 6 ("Grandsire II") cast the Verb B method's
  rules but left them dormant; THIS round set the bells actually ringing
  in transformed order — Verb B is wired and live-capable. Arrived cold
  via the zip + loose HANDOFF; ran the §5 battery on arrival — all green
  (canary-tested lint failed-then-reverted; 65/65 tests; check:all exit 0;
  38 modules parse; old.html ES5-clean and md5-identical to Bourdon's
  record b8dd5f5a4c8fed0765c982a9ccc43204; index triple at 6.11.0; SW
  1.17.0). FIRST FINDING, from the owner not the code: the inherited
  handoff said "nothing past 6.4.0 is live" — WRONG; the owner had
  deployed the whole 6.5→6.11 stack and confirmed 6.11.0 live (Building
  Bells screenshot: anchors survived the anchor-strip fix, lock-note reads
  right with admin on/off). §2 corrected; the "handoff deploy-state is the
  previous session's belief, not truth — confirm with the owner" lesson
  earned again. Then, on "wire verb B, friend," SHIPPED 6.12.0: the
  three-part wiring §7 specified (resolution path modules 20→14 mirroring
  the emergency shift; recipe-builder UI in module 34; I1 banner extended)
  — details in §6/§7/CHANGELOG. Key facts for the successor: (a) chose
  module 14's resolveAllBellTimes as the application point over §7's
  "module 16 sites" suggestion — 16 is where the shift is STORED, but 14
  is where it's APPLIED to merged copies, and that's the invariant that
  keeps localSchedulePeriods pristine (§4.6); recipes fold onto base
  COPIES pre-merge for the same reason. (b) transforms are independent of
  Verb A — refreshActiveTransforms runs before the base-switch guards, so
  a teacher on their normal base still gets transformed. (c) extend target
  stored by NAME not periodId, on purpose (one recipe fits every schedule
  with a like-named period). (d) describeRecipe is exported from 20 and
  reused in 34 so the banner and the entry list can't drift. (e) engine
  UNTOUCHED (1.8.0) — this was pure glue + UI; the +1 test is a pipeline
  test that folds recipes exactly as module 14 does. 6.12.0 is a
  files-only single deploy on live 6.11.0 (DEPLOY-6.12.0.md), NO rules
  change. Battery green post-change (66/66). NEXT SLICE (§7 Layer 4): the
  prefill calendar GRID with generators (desktop-grade; the day-of modal
  already covers I2), then the long pole — WALL-CLOCK FOLLOW-ALONG, which
  needs precomputed resolved times in the calendar doc (I3) + a REST rules
  carve-out so ES5 old.html can read designations AND transforms without
  doing recipe math. Names taken: Quasimodo, Inky, Otto, Whitechapel,
  Bourdon, Grandsire (+"Grandsire II"), Stedman.
  SAME SESSION, owner deployed 6.12.0 ("6.12 is live, Stedman — please
  continue!") and said continue: SHIPPED 6.13.0, The Prefill Grid (Layer 4
  "plan the weeks", first of its two planning UIs). New module 35 —
  a navigable 6-week calendar that reads config/schedule_calendar, opens
  the day-of modal (34) preset to any clicked date, and repeats a day's
  plan weekly. Deliberately reused 34's authoring instead of
  reimplementing it — grid hides while 34 is up and reshows via
  CustomEvents (ellis-designation-closed / ellis-calendar-changed) so 34
  never imports 35 (cycle-free). Also EXTRACTED the base-dedup/
  transform-append rule from 34 into engine 1.9.0's mergeCalendarEntry —
  pure, tested (67/67), shared by the modal and the grid copy-forward
  (the 6.8.0 "extract-and-prove" pattern again; module 34 rewired to call
  it, behavior identical). SCOPE CALL: deferred the rotation-cycle
  generator (slip-forward / calendar-locked) — the design itself flags it
  aspirational/for-other-schools (Ellis doesn't rotate), so shipping the
  grid + repeat-weekly as a bounded, useful-alone release was the right
  cut; rotation is documented as the next grid bite in §7. 6.13.0 is
  built + battery-verified (67/67, 39 modules, check:all exit 0,
  canary'd lint on the 39-module tree, old.html untouched) but NOT yet
  deployed at time of writing — DEPLOY-6.13.0.md is files-only, NO rules
  change, but adds one NEW module (verify it uploads). Successor: confirm
  6.13.0 deploy state with the owner first; then either the rotation
  generator (finishes the grid) or the wall-clock follow-along long pole.
  STILL SAME SESSION (owner: brainstormed a batch of ideas, approved the
  "invariant-safe" path, "make that CDC teacher's life as simple as
  possible!", "continue"): first gave a FEASIBILITY read (see below), then
  SHIPPED 6.14.0, Home Schedule. The owner's ideas and how they landed:
  (a) TEMPLATE / tag-assign / "Ms. Johnson automagically" → built as a
  per-teacher HOME schedule (roster.defaultScheduleId), set explicitly
  per-uid, in bulk via a filter→schedule→"set for all matching" template.
  This is the invariant-safe reading the owner approved: tags filter the
  picker, an explicit per-person default is stored, nothing resolves a tag
  at ring time — so CDC (3 grade tags) is set to one schedule directly.
  (b) "people like me" linking a custom copy to the base → EXPLAINED it's
  already the model (personal schedule carries baseScheduleId; relative
  bells anchored to base period edges survive base edits + Verb B
  transforms for free — verified in the 6.12.0 wiring). The gap is
  alternate-BASE transfer (switch a personal user to a different base and
  carry the overlay) — still the unbuilt Layer 2 last slice. applyHomeSchedule
  deliberately NEVER yanks a personal-schedule user, protecting exactly
  this case. (c) stretch-into-4th collision resolver with spread-across-
  checkboxes → feasible on the existing period-edge math (the shorten
  recipe already cascades), but it's a new recipe archetype + a live
  collision modal = its own release; deferred. (d) untagged-teacher nudge
  → the natural next slice, rides presence+roster; deferred as its own
  bite (pairs with 6.14.0). METHOD: module 20's resolution was
  RESTRUCTURED (mandate vs home) — the risky bit — so I preserved the
  scoped/exception/weekday behavior exactly (applyMandate reproduces the
  old path; engine split proven by tests) and made home purely additive
  and silent. 6.13.0 + 6.14.0 both built + battery green (68/68) but
  UNDEPLOYED at close. Successor: confirm what's live; then the untagged
  nudge, the rotation generator, or the alternate-base/wall-clock long pole.
  STILL SAME SESSION (owner: "Let's do untagged teachers," then next turn
  "6.14 is live" + reported a bug): confirmed 6.13.0 + 6.14.0 LIVE, then
  SHIPPED 6.15.0 = untagged-teacher nudge (module 36) PLUS a bugfix the
  owner flagged — the "new version available" toast firing on every hard
  refresh. Diagnosed precisely (controller read LIVE at statechange races
  skipWaiting/claim on an uncontrolled hard-refresh load) and fixed by
  capturing wasControlledAtLoad up front (see the new §9 gotcha); kept
  skipWaiting/claim so the TVs still auto-update. Bundled feature+fix into
  one y-release since the nudge was already done in-tree; told the owner
  they could split if they wanted a fix-only hotfix. Process note: a
  malformed `grep … | head file` (grep reading stdin) HUNG a bash call into
  the timeout — after a timeout, CHECK tree state before re-running bumps
  (the sed edits had already landed; only the trailing grep hung). 6.15.0
  battery-green (68/68, 40 modules), UNDEPLOYED at close. Backlog unchanged:
  rotation-cycle generator, stretch/spread collision resolver, alternate-
  base transfer + wall-clock follow-along. Names taken: Quasimodo, Inky,
  Otto, Whitechapel, Bourdon, Grandsire (+"Grandsire II"), Stedman.
  STILL SAME SESSION (owner: "6.15 is live, not notifying me now" [toast fix
  confirmed], "continue with the plan"): SHIPPED 6.16.0, period overrun
  DETECTION — the safe first half of the collision resolver the owner
  dreamed up. Investigated the period model first (name-derived groupings,
  no explicit boundaries — see §3) and made a deliberate SCOPE CALL:
  overlap detection is a heuristic and the interactive fix is destructive
  multi-bell surgery on the sacred live-edit path, so I shipped a READ-ONLY
  detector (engine 1.11.0 detectPeriodOverlaps + module 37 red banner) and
  DEFERRED the shrink/spread/allow resolver until the owner confirms the
  warning reads their real schedules without false positives. Told the owner
  exactly that and asked them to report any cry-wolf. Also caught + fixed a
  latent bug while in the engine: BellEngine.VERSION had been stuck at
  '1.8.0' for two releases (header bumps missed the constant; battery
  doesn't check it) — now 1.11.0, logged as a §9 gotcha with a suggested
  guard. 6.16.0 battery-green (69/69, 41 modules), UNDEPLOYED at close.
  Backlog now: the collision RESOLVER (the fix half — §7), rotation
  generator, alternate-base transfer + wall-clock long pole.
