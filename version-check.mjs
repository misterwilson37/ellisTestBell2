// Tentacalendar — version-check.mjs  (2.0 / OCTODO LINE)
// Version 1.9.0 — knows about typed-date.test.mjs.
//
// THE THING SIX FILES ALREADY TOLD YOU TO RUN.
//
// `app.js`, `store.js`, `queue.js`, `index.html`, `CHANGELOG.md` and
// `HANDOFF-2.0.md` have all instructed the reader to run
// `node version-check.mjs` before handing anything over. It did not exist.
// Every one of those instructions was a prose warning wearing a command's
// clothes — which is the exact failure mode the warnings were written to
// stop. Four banner/constant drifts and four stale `?v=` pins accumulated
// under a check nobody could run.
//
// It checks three things and nothing else:
//
//   1. BANNER vs CONSTANT. Every file declares its version twice — once in
//      the comment header a human reads first, once in the constant the code
//      actually uses. They must agree.
//
//   2. PIN vs TARGET. Every `?v=` cache-bust must equal the version of the
//      file it points at. A pin one patch behind is WORSE than no pin: the
//      file uploads cleanly and the browser serves the cached old one, so
//      the fix appears shipped and is not. This is how a repaired bug comes
//      back in a smoke test.
//
//   3. HANDOFF TABLE vs REALITY. The version row at the top of
//      HANDOFF-2.0.md is what the next instance believes. If it disagrees
//      with the files, the next instance starts wrong.
//
// Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = something drifted. No dependencies, no install.
//
// Run from the repo root:  node version-check.mjs

// lines away from the constant it must agree with — which is how they drifted
// apart four separate times, the last one costing a deploy. The rule was
// written down, and by 2026-08-02 app.js was back to 19 entries and 135 lines
// with nothing to stop it. Jake, unprompted: *"comments are getting deep
// again in some of the files."*

// fail. So it is a check. Entries below the cap go to CHANGELOG.md verbatim.

// banner: the version in the comment header.  constant: the one code uses.
// label:  what this file is called in the handoff's **Versions** row.

// ⚠️ 1.4.0 — THIS IS NOW THE ONLY LIST. It used to be three: FILES, then
// LABELS, then rowOrder, each hand-written, each having to be extended
// whenever a file joined. That is the shape that has bitten this project
// four times (the keep-list that ate `completedBy`, the ?v= pins, whereis's
// column header, and this). LABELS and the paste-able row are now DERIVED
// from the `label` below, so adding a file here adds it everywhere.
