// Tentacalendar — app.js  (2.0 / OCTODO LINE)
// Version 2.4.0
//
// Rendering, interaction, views. Ported from 1.x with four seams changed.
// All Firebase access goes through store.js; no Firestore calls here.
//
// 2.4.0 — KATIE'S FIRST FEEDBACK ON 2.3.0 (Cyanea). Every date field can be
//          TYPED (makeTypeable; 📅 still opens the phone's calendar). ▸ on a
//          Today project row opens its whole pipeline to tick in ANY order
//          (buildStageList, shared with the card). Clock-in reads "▶ Clock
//          in" — ⏱ looked like a reschedule button. 📋 remembers the date
//          chip per project (dupDefaultShift).
// 2.3.0 — KATIE'S HANDWRITTEN LIST (Cyanea). 📋 Duplicate any project, with
//          one-tap date shifts (her Android laundry case); Save stages as a
//          template; tasks from a project listed beside its stages; ⋮⋮ drag
//          to reorder; year-view tier chips; ⏱ and ✎ on Today rows; project
//          and task edits pop up where you click. "After end" follow-ups wait
//          for the real finish, and runRepeg() fixes the ones already dated.
//          Also fixed: Pipeline "+ New" threw since 2.1.1; Duplicate dropped
//          🎆, its ↳ +Nd, and every outrider stage.
// 2.2.0 — SOFT DELETE (§0k.3). A project's ✕ removes it from the timeline
//          and KEEPS its record: sessions, ticked stages, credit. Undo puts
//          it straight back; octodoBinned() lists and restores from the
//          console until Settings → Data exists. ⚠️ S.projects is now LIVING
//          projects and S.projectsAll includes the binned — the Time Report,
//          projName and the CSV read `All` on purpose, everything else must
//          not. The confirm copy no longer says the hours die, because they
//          do not; do not restore the old wording.
// 2.1.1 — ⚠️ SAVE-1 IS SOLVED, AND IT WAS NEVER ABOUT TIER DAYS. The
//          importer synthesised a project type with no `id`; the Settings
//          draft copied `id: undefined` and setDoc refuses undefined. It
//          fired on every Settings save because the draft is built on OPEN
//          and written unconditionally. Repaired here so the stored document
//          heals on the next save; the importer is fixed at 1.0.2.
// 2.1.0 — OUTRIDER STAGES BECOME TASKS (§0h). A stage anchored outside
//          [startDate, endDate] leaves the pipeline and becomes a dated task.
//          isLater MEASURES startDate AGAIN and the pipeline-window branch is
//          deleted — it was scaffolding for a rule Jake withdrew on 08-01.
//          syncOutridersFor() runs after create, edit, bar drag and stage
//          edit; it is never awaited before a modal closes, because the save
//          is what the user asked for and the spawn is bookkeeping.
//          ⚠️ Katie's existing projects need the ONE-OFF SWEEP: run
//          `octodoOutriders()` from the console (dry run by default).
// 2.0.0, 1.46.0, 1.45.0, 1.44.0, 1.43.0 — see CHANGELOG.md.
//
// ⚠️ Full version history is in CHANGELOG.md. Keep this header SHORT —
//    it grew to hundreds of lines, which is how the banner and the
//    constant below drifted apart four times. The constant sits on the
//    next line on purpose: you cannot edit one without seeing the other.
//    Verify with `node version-check.mjs` before handing anything over.

/**
 * 1.33.0 — A REFUSED ROUTE HAS TO REACH THE PERSON.
 *
 * store 0.24.0 made the two board resolvers throw instead of guessing, which
 * is the right direction but only pays out if somebody is told. Almost every
 * store call in this file is a bare `.then()` with no `.catch()`, so an
 * unrouted write would have become an unhandled rejection: a console line
 * nobody reads, and a task that silently did not get created. That is the
 * SAME failure shape as the bug being fixed, one layer up.
 *
 * So the net is global rather than twenty added `.catch()` clauses: one
 * listener, so no future call site can forget. Route errors get a sentence
 * (the person's correct move is to retry, and the message says so); anything
 * else is logged loudly and left alone, because inventing a dialog for every
 * possible rejection is how you train somebody to dismiss dialogs.
 *
 * `routingSnapshot` is exposed on `window` for the same reason: it is the
 * distinguishing experiment §0a asked for, and it should be one console call
 * rather than an edit-and-redeploy.

 *
 *  It MOVES the node; it does not clone it. A second button would mean two
 *  ids or one live listener and one dead control, and a dead sign-out button
 *  is a worse bug than the crowding it would be fixing. The click handler is
 *  bound to the element, so it rides along.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `matchMedia` and not a resize listener: this fires on rotation and on a
 *  desktop window drag, both, and it fires exactly once per crossing rather
 *  than sixty times a second. 600px matches the phone block in the CSS —
 *  ⚠️ CHANGE ONE AND YOU MUST CHANGE THE OTHER, which is this project's most

// ---------- D130: update check ----------
// Katie was running a stale cache when the tub bug hit her (an old queue.js
// that did epoch math on a want-to's null dates). A running tab has no way
// to know a newer version shipped — its APP_VERSION is baked into the JS it
// already loaded. So: hourly, re-fetch index.html itself (cache-BUSTED, or
// the browser hands back the same stale file and defeats the point) and read
// its data-html-version — the ONE stamp Jake bumps on every single deploy,
// so there's no second source of truth to drift (that was the deciding
// reason over a separate version.json: the index already carries its
// version, compare against that). If the server's html version differs from
// this tab's, show a banner and auto-refresh after a countdown. Compares
// against the tab's OWN loaded value (captured at boot, not re-read from the
// DOM), so it fires exactly once per real deploy.

 * D130 checks ONE stamp — index.html's. That catches an ordinary deploy and
 * misses the thing that actually ate 2026-07-30: a `?v=` pin left pointing at
 * the version before the one on the server. The file uploads, index.html is
 * never cached so it loads fresh, and it then asks the browser for a URL the
 * browser already has — so the fix is live on the server and the tab keeps
 * running the old code. Nothing on screen says so. It cost an evening of
 * chasing bugs that had already been fixed.
 *
 * ⚠️ 1.36.0 — SO CHECK EVERY FILE, AGAINST THE SERVER, FROM THE BROWSER.
 * Each module states its version twice: in a banner near the top and in a
 * constant. The constant is what this tab is RUNNING. The banner is what the
 * server is SERVING. Fetch the first slice of each file with the cache
 * bypassed, read the banner, compare.
 *
 * Jake, 2026-07-30, on being offered this as a separate page: *"Isn't the
 * whole point of the hover the version check? Why would I want to open a new
 * page?"* Correct. It belongs where he already looks, so the result goes into
 * the badge's tooltip and, when something is stale, onto the badge itself —
 * a check you have to remember to run is a check that does not get run.
 *
 * Only the FIRST CHUNK of each file is read (the reader is cancelled after
 * it), so this does not pull 300KB of app.js an hour to look at line 3.

// results in colour, on a screen nobody is staring at. This makes the SAME
// engine audible. It invents no new schedule: a task nags on ITS OWN D3
// escalation cadence (already per-task, already configurable), so the
// feature Katie has been ignoring is the feature that now speaks.
//
// THREE CHANNELS, one master switch, all PER-DEVICE (D107's rule — the TV
// is a device, the phone is not; a beeping phone in a client meeting is
// exactly the thing she's already ignoring):
//   · toast   — an in-page banner. THE LOAD-BEARING ONE ON THE WALL: a
//               system notification is drawn by the OS and a fullscreen
//               kiosk may never show it. This one is ours, so it always
//               appears. Outside #drift-wrap (D37/D127).
//   · sound   — Web Audio, SYNTHESIZED. No asset to host, no file to 404,
//               works offline, and three distinguishable shapes mean you
//               can tell what happened without looking up.
//   · notify  — the OS notification, for a windowed tab.
//
// READS THROUGH buildQueue, NEVER through S.tasks. That is the whole
// safety of it: hidden tiers (D47), off-days (D61), timeless want-tos
// (D126), pipeline windows (D48) and expiry all already live in there.
// Re-deriving "what is overdue" from raw tasks would be a second truth,
// and D98 is this file's standing warning about what those cost. It is
// also evaluated for TODAY explicitly — not S.viewDay — because paging
// the queue to next Thursday must not silence the alarm.

// ============================================================
// D101 — THE GESTURE LOCK.
//
// render() is a Firestore SNAPSHOT HANDLER (subscribeTasks/Projects/... all
// call it), not just a timer target. So a drag CANNOT simply skip renders:
// "if (dragging) return" would DISCARD a live update from Katie's phone, not
// postpone it, and silent-loss in a live-sync accountability app is a worse
// bug than the one being fixed. It defers and flushes instead.
//
// Scope check first: the drags already SURVIVE a mid-drag re-render by
// design — listeners are on document (D73) and the ghosts are body-level
// fixed precisely so the minute tick can't hide them (D74). What actually
// breaks is cosmetic: the .dragging dim resets and the preview snaps. So
// this is a polish fix with a correctness trap inside it, which is exactly
// why it gets a real mechanism instead of a one-liner.
//
// THE SAFETY VALVE: if a pointerup is ever lost (browser quirk, a tab
// backgrounded mid-drag, a pointercancel that never lands), a stuck lock
// would silently freeze live sync FOREVER — the app would look fine and
// quietly stop being true. That is unacceptable in this app specifically, so
// tick() force-clears any gesture older than 30s. No real drag lasts 30
// seconds; a lock that does is a bug, and it fails OPEN.

// so both screens see the undo like any other change. Scope: the drags —
// year-bar moves/stretches and clock-estimate grips. Native undo inside
// text fields is untouched (the handler steps aside for inputs).
// D116 — two stacks, full redo. Every entry carries BOTH directions,
// captured at commit time when before and after are both in hand. A new
// action forks history: the redo stack dies (the old future is gone).
// EXCLUDED on principle, argued to Jake and accepted: completion toggles —
// checking a task fires celebrations, materializes follow-ups, spawns
// cacti, and UN-checking already owns a richer undo (the D53 oops/rewind/
// keep modal). A silent Ctrl-Z bypassing those semantics would be worse.

// ---------- D134: Escape closes the topmost modal ----------
//
// Jake: "the equivalent of clicking the ✕ — no save," and if something
// changed, it should confirm. That last part costs NOTHING here, because
// this handler does not close anything itself: it CLICKS THE MODAL'S OWN
// cancel button. Every guard (D129/D131), every bit of state cleanup
// (fuTarget, clockMode, S.dupTarget), and every special case (stages
// returning you to the dup form) already lives in those handlers, so
// reimplementing "close" here would be a second copy destined to drift
// out of sync with the first — exactly the D98 failure. One source of
// truth for closing; Escape is just another way to press the button.
//
// The mapped button is each modal's NEVER-MIND, not a raw hide: the
// decision modals get their no-op answer (uncheck → "oops", it stays
// done; weekend → "back"), because leaving one hidden-but-unresolved
// would strand S.uncheckTarget / S.weekendPending.
//
// TOPMOST = LAST OPEN IN DOM ORDER. Every shell shares z-index 50, so
// paint order IS document order; querySelectorAll returns document order,
// so the last un-hidden shell is the one on top and the one Escape should
// answer. That's self-maintaining — a new modal joins the ordering for
// free — and the ship-check asserts every shell has an entry here, so a
// future modal can't silently arrive without an Escape.
//
// NOTE for whoever adds modal #12: because they all share z-index 50 and
// #dup-modal is LAST in the markup, dup would paint over anything it ever
// coexisted with. Today nothing does (each explicitly hides the other),
// but if you ever want two on screen at once, that's the trap.

/**
 * ⚠️ 2.3.0 — DUPLICATE IS NO LONGER ONLY "FOR NEXT YEAR". Katie's item 1:
 * *"Duplicate project (edit name, date range, etc.)"*, and her reason, via
 * Jake: duplicating laundry "so that it wasn't a full year away", which on
 * Android meant back-clicking a calendar picker one month at a time.
 *
 * Two doors, one modal:
 *   · `finished: true`  — the old offer after the fireworks. Same copy, same
 *     follow-up box and snooze, +1 year pre-selected. Unchanged in spirit.
 *   · `finished: false` — the 📋 on any card, any time. A plain copy: no
 *     "the project stays finished" follow-up box (it may not be), no snooze
 *     (there is nothing to be reminded of), and Cancel instead of No thanks.
 *
 * The date-shift chips are the Android answer: every chip measures from the
 * ORIGINAL dates, so tapping is never cumulative and never needs the picker.
 *
 * Also fixed on the way through, both found reading this function:
 *   · the copy DROPPED 🎆 and its ↳ +Nd, so next year's run had no climax and
 *     no follow-up. Both are carried now (never `spawnedTaskId` — that is the
 *     record that THIS year's follow-up already happened).
 *   · the copy DROPPED every outrider. Since 2.1.0 those live as tasks, not
 *     stages, so "copy the pipeline" silently left out the engagement letter
 *     and the invoice. They are rebuilt from the tasks (queue
 *     outriderStageFromTask) and go back in at the ends, where syncOutriders
 *     turns them into the new project's own tasks on create.

 *  now the only way to say so was `↳ +Nd` on the 🎆 stage, decided back when
 *  the pipeline was built, before anybody knew.
 *
 *  ⚠️ INDEPENDENT OF THE DUPLICATE, ON PURPOSE. Its own button, its own
 *  write. She can add a follow-up AND create next year's run, or add one and
 *  snooze the duplicate, or add one and say No thanks. Hanging it off
 *  dupConfirm would have made the commonest case — a follow-up on a project
 *  that does not repeat — impossible to reach.
 *
 *  ⚠️ THE STAGE'S `spawnedTaskId` GUARD DOES NOT COVER THIS, and pretending
 *  otherwise would be the fifth "comment more confident than its code" of the
 *  session. That guard stops an AUTOMATIC spawn firing twice when a hurrah is
 *  un-ticked and re-ticked. This is a person clicking a button that says Add
 *  it, which should do what it says every time. So the guard here is
 *  narrower and honest: the button disables after a successful write so one
 *  click cannot become two, and re-opening the modal deliberately allows
 *  another — because a second click on a second visit IS a second intention.
 *
 *  Dated from TODAY rather than from the project's end date: the project is
 *  finished now, and "in 14 days" means fourteen days from the moment you
 *  said it, not from a planned end that may be weeks behind you.

 *  its baseline:
 *
 *    · `subscribeProjects` → `suggestProjectColor()` → writes #project-color
 *    · `subscribeProjectTypes` → `refreshTypeSelect()` → writes #project-type
 *
 *  Both fields are in `projectFormSignature()`. And `bestFreeColor()` picks
 *  the colour furthest from the ones already in use, so ADDING A PROJECT
 *  changes the suggestion — which is why his repro needed a new project and
 *  the original repro did not. *"Added a new project, hard refresh three
 *  times, hit the pencil on the project, and it told me I have unsaved
 *  changes."*
 *
 *  This is §8c #4 verbatim, committed by the instance that wrote §8c down:
 *  harden one call, leave its twins, ship. The rule stands — **when you
 *  harden one call, grep for every other caller of the same thing.**

 *  build `.yvg-lanes` — week rows nested inside month cells in a CSS grid,
 *  dozens of them, whose height is not what drives that layout. Sharing

  // already imported. The importer is fixed too (1.0.2), for boards that
  // have not been.
  //
  // ⚠️ An id-less type was also unusable, silently: the New Project selector

/** ⚠️ SAVE MUST NEVER FAIL SILENTLY, AND IT DID.
 *
 *  Katie, an hour after the flip: *"clicking save settings didn't do
 *  anything… changing the days of a tier didn't close on save settings
 *  either. Maybe it's saving, but it's not closing the window. Hitting the X
 *  gave us an unsaved progress warning."*
 *
 *  That symptom PAIR is one fact. The body below ends with
 *  `delete dirtySnapshots["settings"]` and then `closeSettings()`. If
 *  anything in it THROWS, both are skipped — so the modal stays open (looks
 *  like nothing happened) AND the old snapshot survives (so ✕ still finds
 *  the form dirty). Jake's read was right: **the writes above the throw had
 *  already gone out. It was saving. It just could not admit it.**
 *
 *  ⚠️ I DO NOT KNOW WHICH LINE THREW, AND I AM NOT GUESSING. Four candidates
 *  were checked and eliminated against the source: a missing `#cfg-*`
 *  element (every id resolves), `saveTierSkin` with an empty board id (it
 *  guards `!wsId` and catches), a null `pipelineDraft` (openSettings sets it
 *  before markClean, and the ✕ warning proves markClean ran), and a missing
 *  `.t-*` field on some row (every row carries all of them, merely hidden).
 *  **After four files with no clean explanation, the honest move is to make
 *  the failure name itself rather than to ship a fifth theory.**
 *
 *  So: the throw is caught, shown to the user, and logged with a stack. The
 *  modal is deliberately LEFT OPEN on failure — closing it would discard
 *  edits whose fate is unknown — and the snapshot is deliberately LEFT
 *  INTACT, so ✕ still warns. That is not the bug; that is the guard working
 *  on the one occasion it should.

/**
 * ⚠️ 2.4.0 — A DATE FIELD YOU CAN TYPE INTO. Katie: *"that's why I want to
 * be able to type in a date from whatever portal I'm using to access."* On
 * Android the native <input type="date"> opens a calendar and nothing else;
 * duplicating laundry from a +1-year default meant clicking back 51 weeks.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. A text box she types into, then 📅. The ORIGINAL date input is
 * not replaced: it keeps its id, its value, its `required`, its listeners —
 * every line of the app that reads `#task-date.value` still reads it — and
 * it sits INVISIBLY ON TOP OF THE 📅 (opacity 0, same box). So tapping 📅
 * is tapping the real date input, and the phone opens its own calendar
 * exactly as before, on every browser, with no showPicker() to be missing.
 *
 * THE SYNC, both ways:
 *   · typed → parsed (queue.parseTypedDate) on change/Enter → written to the
 *     date input, which then fires `input` and `change` like a pick would;
 *   · everything else → the text. The instance's `value` setter is wrapped,
 *     so the app's own `el.value = …` (defaults, edit, the dup chips, Today)
 *     updates the text too, and a pick fires `input`/`change`.
 * Unreadable text turns red and sets its OWN validity, so a form submit
 * stops on the text box with the reason — never silently keeps the old date.
 * Non-form buttons (Duplicate, the ⏰ modal) ask typedDatesValid() first.
 */
